## About the Revolutionary Government of Armed Forces

Following a coup in 1968, Juan Velasco Alvarado assumed the position of President for the new _Gobierno Revolucionario de las Fuerzas Armadas_ (Revolutionary Government of Armed Forces). This government quickly implemented a series of leftist reforms to address the historical injustices of the Peruvian state. Most notably, Velasco was concerned with the treatment of the Quechua- and Aymara-speaking _campesino_ (rural) populations of Peru.

During this time, Velasco passed a variety of reforms focused on economic redistribution, including refinancing the national debt, agrarian reform, and a major investment into education, health, and housing. These reforms also included the nationalization of news media (1974) and the official recognition of Quechua language as an equally valid language to Spanish in education, law, and government.

These conditions are what made the creation of _Cronicawan_, a state-supported Quechua-language newspaper, possible. 

## About _Cronicawan_

**_Cronicawan_ was published briefly for 16 or 17 issues in 1975.**  
Cronicawan ran for 16 or 17 issues _(yupana)_ from June _(Inti Raymi Killa)_ to September _(Chajra Yapuy killa)_ in 1975. The first 11 issues were produced at a broadsheet size and produced primarily in Quechua _(Runasimi)_. Issues 2-11 included a double-sided insert page that contained translations of the articles into Spanish. Each of the first 11 issues sold for 4 soles, which was subsidized by the Velasco government as part of _Ley No. 21156_. Starting with issue 12, the newspaper was produced at a smaller A4 (standard magazine) size, and featured articles that were written in parallel, first in Quechua and after translated into Spanish. These later editions sold for 4.50 soles. Production ended shortly after the military coup of Francisco Morales Bermúdez on August 29, 1975, which deposed Velasco and later walked back many of the reforms regarding Quechua language and Indigenous engagement that were established during this time.

The collection displayed here contains 15 issues of the extant 16 or 17 issues. See the page **About the Digitization Project** for more details.

**Who created _Cronicawan_?**  
Cronicawan’s editors and main contributors included Guillermo Thorndike, Angel Avendaño, Luis Gonzales Posada, and Hernando Aguirre Gamio. Thorndike, a Lima-based journalist was deeply involved in the journalistic scene before the expropriation of newspapers by Velasco. He founded the newspaper Ojo, which was named specifically in Decreto Ley No. 20681, and was later the directorate of the newspapers La Tercera and La Crónica. Angel Avendaño, Luis Gonzales Posada, and Hernando Aguirre were Cusco-born, Lima-based Quechua speakers who wrote a majority of the articles within the newspaper. 

**What did _Cronicawan_ include?**  
Cronicawan emerged as a product of the ideological shifts emphasized in the Velasco government, serving not only as a medium for state messaging but also as a platform where Quechua speakers could engage with national and international affairs through their own linguistic and cultural lens. 

_Cronicawan_ included sections for national news, international news, reader submissions, art and poetry, and resources for learning Quechua. The tagline, _Revolusionpa Rimaynin_, can be translated as "Talk of the Revolution" or "The Revolution Speaks". See the **Index** for full documentation of the issues displayed on this site and their layouts.

## Index

Wax was created for individuals and groups who either don't have or don't want to use a lot of resources to create their scholarly or cultural exhibits. It's best suited for folks who are willing to take on some technical responsibility in exchange for a lot of flexibility.

For beginners, Wax has a relatively high, but general-purpose learning curve. To get the most out of Wax, you should have some familiarity with:

- Using an interactive shell (e.g., Bash/Terminal) to install and interact with programs, files, and directories on your local computer.
- Using Git and GitHub to version control and collaborate on projects.
- Using Jekyll to generate static sites.
- Creating and normalizing data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, YAML)
- Using file-naming conventions and best practices.
- Editing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.

**However, Wax is also great for teaching or learning the skills above!** For examples of digital pedagogy via the creation of Wax exhibitions, check out [this workshop](https://studentcouncil.college.columbia.edu/events/introduction-minimal-computing-humanities-building-exhibit-primary-sources-using-wax), [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/stylerevolution/stylerevolution.github.io), and [this custom Wax site](https://stylerevolution.github.io/).

**Wax is also phenomenal for professionals who play a facilitating role**, such as Digital Scholarship Librarians or Coordinators. With some practice, Wax substantially reduces the time to production and post-production maintenance costs for you and your team. In the most common scenario, students, faculty, colleagues or any other collaborators just have to provide you with a properly formatted spreadsheet and the text for the exhibits. The extras are up to you.


## So what does the Wax workflow *look like?*

Below is a diagram to give you a zoomed-out view. In summary, you create a file of metadata records for your collection (in CSV, YAML, or JSON format), organize your collection image files, and put both in the Jekyll site folder. After updating your configuration, you run a few command line tasks to prepare the data and metadata for use by the Jekyll site. Jekyll then uses special layouts and Wax components to build the exhibit and spits them out as static pages ready to publish.

From there, you can run tests on your site to catch errors and decide where and how to put it online or in offline media.
