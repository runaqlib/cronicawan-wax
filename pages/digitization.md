**Finding The Newspapers**
Funds from the Tinker grant allowed me to travel to the Centro Bartolome de las Casas (CBC) in Cusco and begin the process of digitalizing, transcribing, and translating these works for work on my thesis for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU. The 15 editions available in the archive had clearly been exposed to water and other elements, which were starting to degrade the paper and make the newspapers fragile. The issues were digitized using a setup with a modified tripod, my iPhone, and the Adobe Scan app.

The issues were then transcribed by myself and members of the Runasimi Outreach Collective at NYU. OCR programs were not able to accurately capture the newspapers because of their varied layout and their content in Quechua. The articles that were not translated into Spanish within the newspaper were then translated by myself, members of ROC, and my thesis advisors, Renzo Aroni and Odi Gonzales, who are native Quechua speakers.
