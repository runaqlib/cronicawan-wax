Digitizing Cronicawan is a project by Alía Warsco, and is my final thesis project for my Master’s of Arts in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU. I also have an MSLIS from Long Island University. Email me at **aliawarsco (at) gmail (dot) com** to provide suggestions, report issues, or reach out about the project.

This project would not have been possible without the incredible support, patience, and encouragement I’ve received from so many people and institutions throughout its creation. I am deeply grateful to the following individuals and communities: 

### In Cusco // _Qosqopi, Sonqoypi_

My warmest thanks go to everyone at the **Centro Bartolome de las Casas** (CBC) in Cusco, Peru. The staff, librarians, and researchers there welcomed me with generosity and kindness. I am especially grateful to Luis Nieto, Anael Pilares, and Leonela Labra Panocca, with whom I shared ideas, office space, and importantly, lunch with during my research. Their insight, humor, and tolerance of my limited Spanish made the work joyful and collaborative. 

### At NYU // _Yachaymasiykunapaq_

I am grateful to the **Tinker Foundation** and ot the **Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies** (CLACS) at NYU, who supported this work despite my delays in travel due to medical resasons. I extend a special thanks to: 

- Dylon Robbins, the director of CLACS, who first encountered the newspapers at CBC, introduced them to me, and encouraged me to pursue this project from the beginning.
- Pamela Calla, who continuously reminded me to go deeper, to ask better questions, and to stay connected to the people and politics at the heart of this work. 
- Renzo Aroni and Odi Gonzales, my thesis advisors, for their expert guidance as Andean scholars, Quechua speakers, and kind collaborators. Their feedback, encouragement, and generosity of knowledge helped to shape this project profoundly. 
- Odi Gonzales deserves a special thanks for the experience of learning Quechua for two years. Yawarmasiy, yupaychani askhata. 
- Amanda Galán, who read every rough draft, felt the pressure together every week, and helped to remind me that I could finish this project. 

### Community Support // _Clase masiykunapaq, Wasimasiykunapaq, Aylluypaqpas_

Many thanks to the [Runasimi Outreach Collective (ROC)](https://www.instagram.com/roc_nyu/), the student-led organization at NYU that advocates for the Quechua language program and the broader Andean community in New York. It has been an honor to be a member since my first semester. Their insights, help with translations, encouragement with brainstorming, and unfaltering positivity were essential -- both intelectually and emotionally -- through every step of this process. 

To my dear friends, roommates, and everyone who I’ve ranted to in the past 4 months: thank you for sticking with me, even when this project was the only thing I could talk about. Your patience, pep talks, and presence meant so much to me. 


### Digital Tools 

This website was built using the open-source Wax framework, which supports digital scholarship and minimal computing through static site generation and IIIF integration. Wax is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led and maintained by [Marii Nyrop](https://marii.info/) and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex). A special thanks to Marii Nyrop, who has always been able to convince me of my own capabilities, and has been there for me when I get stuck.
