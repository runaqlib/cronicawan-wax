### Welcome to Digitizing _Cronicawan_

_Cronicawan_ was Peru’s first and only state-supported Quechua-language newspaper, published in 1975 during the Revolutionary Government of Juan Velasco Alvarado. As both a tool of state making and a rare platform for Quechua-language journalism, Cronicawan offers valuable insights into Indigenous media representation and engagement in issues like agrarian reform, extractivism, community, and revolutionary discourse in 20th-century Peru. You can learn more <a href="/cronicawan-wax/about-cronicawan/">about the newspaper</a> and <a href="/cronicawan-wax/digitization-project/">about the digitization project</a>. View the <a href="/cronicawan-wax/credits/">credits</a> for important information about the origins and creation of the project.
