### Welcome to Digitizing Cronicawan

_Cronicawan_ was Peruâ€™s first and only state-supported Quechua-language newspaper, published in 1975 during the Revolutionary Government of Juan Velasco Alvarado. As both a tool of state making and a rare platform for Quechua-language journalism, Cronicawan offers valuable insights into Indigenous representation, thoughts on agrarian reform, extractivism, community, and revolutionary discourse in 20th-century Peru. You can learn more <a href="/cronicawan-wax/about-cronicawan/">about the newspaper</a> and <a href="/cronicawan-wax/digitization-project/">about the digitization project</a>.

This digital archive is a work in progress. Full transcriptions and translations into Spanish and English are currently available for select issues, with more being added as the project develops. Explore the  <a href="/cronicawan-wax/index/">Index</a> to learn more about the available editions and the content of each edition, or browse the collection below.
