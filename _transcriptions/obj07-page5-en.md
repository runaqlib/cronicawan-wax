  _THE BEAUTY OF QUECHUA_
  
  Beyond all subjectivism, the Great Quechua Revolution, or Runasimi, symbolized by the legendary Inca Pachacutec, is taking place in the country. Traditional Quechua is energized with splendor and beauty of lush grace. It is universalized through the communication of poetry, using Spanish as its neutral ground. Hybridisms and Latinizations of the Regnicola dialect are purified. Quechua is a structural language, humanizing and therefore direct. Glotted and sweet, sharp and ironic, it permeates the marrow with remote tenacity. Cohesive and generative, it conjugates with expressive turns that surpass all languages. Quechua was born from the impact of telluric forces, as the language of nature itself. Arcanid, onomatopoeic, voice of rain, howling wind, fulgent lightning bolt, Konti Apus, guardian of earthquakes, mystical oblation of the ñujch"u flower. Its antiquity survives the great cataclysms of the tormented American continent. Its origins are generalized by Sartre "in the adventure of the century of the linguists in the use and abuse of diachrony" and, in the revisionists of the Inca, with the Chanca complex and in the "scientistic" experience of Torero de vuelta de la Molina. We need Quechua for the great scientific clarifications with Quechua geniotics and polysemantics with the highest morals and discipline. Quechua is needed for cultural and historical studies of Peru. To investigate the toponymic origins and motivations of American geopolitics. Of Andean ecology, of human groups, plants and animals. For the rationalization. of the civilizing structuralism of the Inca and pre-Inca esoteric world. Likewise, the teaching of Basic Professional Quechua must be imparted as an unavoidable fact, freeing us from the tenacious crust of colonialism in a consumer society plagued by remnants. No university student should graduate without first completing "college" alongside peasants who speak Quechua, Aymara, or Kavkazized dialects such as Anka and Ancashino. Linguists, anthropologists, historians, sociologists, etc., are obligated. Quechua, therefore, survives the genocidal curtailment of the invader. As the distinguished Americanist Jesús Lara summarizes: "There will be no greater enslaver than he who was a slave. Nor more greedy than he who has experienced secular hunger." All the efforts made by the invader—and later by their successors, the oligarchy and imperialism—to liquidate the Runa and Runasimi races have ultimately proved ridiculous. In our revolution, we need to revolutionize our language; that is, to give birth to our Tupac Amaru in literature.

  _SAVINGS ARE INTANGIBLE_
  
  In a recent press conference, the Minister of Economy and Finance, General Amilcar Vargas Gavilano, emphatically stated that the savings of families and businesses are sacred and intangible. This is how he counters unfounded rumors that were intended to sow panic among savers and thus cause considerable damage to the national economy. The Minister pointed out that every time the Revolutionary Government has taken important economic policy measures, such as the recently approved price and wage adjustments, such rumors arise. He also noted that this adjustment is aimed precisely at combating inflation, which is the greatest enemy of family savings and business profitability. The price and wage adjustments will have a favorable effect on family and business savings, and not, as the authors of malicious rumors claim, a negative effect. Given this clarification by the Minister of Economy and Finance, it is legitimate to question the source and intentions of such rumors. It is clear to everyone that the counterrevolution in Peru is actively moving in the shadows to achieve its fundamental objective, that is, to destabilize the Revolutionary Government. To this end, it employs a wide variety of resources. These include organizing street riots like those of February 5, the formation of shock troops to generate discontent in union circles, the dissemination of false news abroad that damages the image of the revolutionary process, infiltration into institutions that support the process, and, finally, economic sabotage. In recent months, it has been easy to observe the simultaneous or alternating use of such resources, without achieving the destabilizing objective. But in recent days, economic sabotage has come to the forefront of counterrevolutionary tactics, aimed at undermining the health of the national economy and thus promoting the
  
  Widespread discontent that facilitates the overthrow of the Revolutionary Government. Rumors about family and business savings must be classified within the framework of the economic sabotage we are pointing out. Multiple experiences around the world demonstrate that one of the most frequently used resources by counterrevolutionary agents is precisely to disrupt the economy, sowing chaos and insecurity. Just a few weeks ago, rumors circulated about an imminent devaluation, and now we find ourselves faced with rumors intended to disorient savers. In both cases, we find a common element: the intention to make people believe that the population's purchasing power will suffer a considerable decline due to a decision by the Revolutionary Government. In both cases, the rumors have been quickly denied, and, naturally, the counterrevolutionary prophecies revealed themselves to be instruments of attack against the Revolutionary Government that were not fulfilled. The attempted maneuver, first spreading rumors about a supposed devaluation and then about the savings of families and companies, must be denounced as political weapons of the oligarchy now displaced from power.

  _YOUNG PEOPLE MEET_TO TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE.
  
  In Paucartambo, young people from all over Peru are gathering to discuss the problems of the people. They are members of the Revolutionary Youth; their banners are the banners of the Revolution, and they walk in accordance with the spirit of revolutionary theory. As we know, the strength of the people lies in their youth. Only young people, with their energy, can move the people forward and make them prosper.
  
  Walking lightly toward better horizons. Youth, like seeds, holds in its blood the dreams of other flowers. That's why the elders say, only in the young do the people's dreams come true. For these reasons, we must truly ponder the meeting of the young people in Paucartambo. There, with their true voices, the young people of Peru are speaking what they see, voicing their thoughts, and reclaiming their ideals. In that first meeting, the young people have already asked for the Superior Court of Justice of Cusco to be truly reorganized. The young people have said: The judges are not fair; they do not measure the poor and the rich with the same criteria, nor do they apply the laws with the spirit with which the government promulgates them. They have also asked for the release of journalists Antonio Noblecilla and Luis Huamán from prison in Cajamarca. At the meeting in Paucartambo, they once again stated: Peru is moving in search of another society; it is not fair for judges to do whatever they please. The young people gathered in Paucartambo meditate on the memory of Tupac Amaru; even Paucartambo is dwarfed by the jubilant laughter of these youths. The youth of the new Peru express: The Revolution is our only path; the Revolution is the path to the progress of the people, and thanks to the revolutionary process, we young people have found our essence of rebellion. Our duty is to live in constant vigilance; the bosses have not yet died; North American imperialism is sinking its claws in; journalists with lying tongues still poison writings. Let us, then, young people, work for our people with a single hand and with a multinational heartbeat. Thus have the young people spoken in Paucartambo, giving wings to their spirits so that they may fly upon the waves of sunlight. They have placed their hearts like seeds before the people, they have sown them forever, like sentinels, parts that watch over the paths of the people. CRONICAWAN salutes the participation of rural youth in Paucartambo in this task of men. CRONICAWAN sees a dawn of eternity that begins the time of flowers and blossoms that the people of Peru have always sought.

  _OF A MAN MORE THAN LOST_
  
  When one returns to the paths of childhood, through courtyards flooded with shade, through endless expanses, through sacred onyx windows, through swings and hoops that were once tattooed with distance, when only childhood grows within the soul like a fever that thins in its own nostalgia, when one finds oneself leaning on one's own sadness, publicly unknown in the neighborhood of one's eleven years, only then—only then—do one discover that happiness was an instant full of flashing dogfights, that happiness was a Sunday morning of thirsty beers, that all sensuality was more than rumors and impure experiences, that gramophones, sobs, and simple sadness are a singsong of fire, of rusty screens, and of perfect boredom. Why remember the past? To think that once we were, that love came to us and left? Why torture ourselves with wounds and visions that tremble somewhere in our twilight. Everything is confusing and tenacious while the beards grow that only death will shave off. Even the secret joy of one day taking revenge on the world is nothing but a dark ritual of our own defeat, because nothing stagnates, everything flows, and if yesterday was better than today, probably the day after tomorrow will be better than today, exactly like that slow and tedious clatter of the train that goes from Cusco to Juliaca through a territory where the dark talisman of injustice still lies. Don't talk to me about the rain, or the intentions for this land from Cusco to Juliaca, even though the brocades and damasks of feudalism are reborn. Words aren't needed to ignore the desolation; just look at these towns, the norms rooted in the customs of yesteryear, this wind of broken clocks that continue to mark the hours of other, simpler times, this pampering, this justice, this pampering, this delay. The train rushes by, panting with its vocation of absences, towns with lime of forgetfulness on their walls submerge for a moment their eternal helplessness through the train windows. The engine glides with furious plenitude, for these
  
  towns the words are sun tomorrow, barely scratches, confused suggestions, the towns remain like pendulums in the distance oscillating in their own solitude. Combapata, Chuquikamata, Tinta, Mach aqmarca, silent villages with latches of tears on their doors, tears in their streets, tears, only tears, above an exhausted sky, an impure murmur of basins, of quinoxes, of nails and flies. what am I doing traveling so much? who am I? The clay already stuns me from so much murky clicking. The towns, like ancient nostalgic taverns, hang from the train window, and I am a man beyond lost, confused between compasses and obligations, an irremediable traveler collapsing and falling asleep, because that's how it has to be between images and spells, an arrogant ringer of defeats. I say goodbye to myself, I play deaf, face down on my own heart. I hate the train windows, the hatreds simply as if they were the liturgy of so much poverty, and I, the one who denied them more than three times, a passing victor who buried himself to redeem himself. It's hard to be hungry, to have a void that weighs, and a distance that never ends. The smile of so much defeat can't be made with flour. PERIOD
