  HAVANA, June 23, 1973 (PL) For La Crónica.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Cuba—Minister Marcos Lage made the following statements in Havana:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In 1976, the Sugar Harvest Industry significantly reduced the number of workers employed in the fields of cutters, railway workers, forklift drivers, and transport workers from production centers to factories.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In 1970, the sugar mill's total number of workers was 120,000, both men and women. Production at that time reached a record 8,500,000 tons.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This reduction will become more pronounced in the coming years. With the same effort, I will increase production, and I will also use more modern machinery for the sugar mills.

  LISBON, June 26 (For LA CRONICA).— The Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Melo Antunez, who is in the capital of Mozambique for the celebration of the independence of that African country, revealed that he hoped that his suggestion that Portugal request its registration in the next meeting of the non-aligned countries to be held in Lima next month would be accepted by the Government in Lisbon.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Melo Antunez added that the upcoming meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Peruvian capital is of particular importance.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He then indicated that, despite the fact that there are still certain discrepancies within the Portuguese government, there is a tendency for Portugal to move closer to the Third World.

  After 450 years, Portuguese colonial rule has been laid to rest. Mozambique returns to freedom. After a prolonged struggle against Portuguese imperialism, it returns to freedom and to the world officially as the People's Republic of Mozambique.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Following the oppression of a minority of whites excluded as exploiters, the flag of the Mozambique Liberation Front flies on the masts of freedom and human dignity.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In Dar Es Salaam, Eduardo Mondladap received a targeted message, which exploded in his hands, cutting short his valuable life and depriving him of the opportunity to attend to the end of the liberation struggle that he had undertaken, politically and militarily as a genuine Commander of Frelimonanta.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Mozambique is a nation condemned to starvation, but it currently survives thanks to aid from other nations. Its leaders are busy day and night distributing this aid.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  To then undertake the great task of recovering them from centuries of oppression and appropriation of their wealth until they were extinguished.

  BELFAST (Northern Ireland) June 26, 1975.-
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Six people were seriously injured when a bomb exploded today in a pub on the outskirts of Belfast, which is frequented by fanatical members of a Protestant organization.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The device, which caused serious damage inside the building, was thrown inside by a man who later fled in a car.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The car was later found abandoned in a central area of the city of Maydia Católica, leading authorities to believe the attack was another incident in the wave of sectarian violence occurring in the province.

  Guatemala, June 24, 1975. (CRONICAPAQ).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Between four and six children die every day in Petén, a department located in northwestern Guatemala, victims of an epidemic known as "black measles." The first reports were brought to Tegucigalpa by special delegates sent to several villages scattered throughout the vast Petén territory, the largest in the country, almost entirely covered in the lush greenery of a pristine jungle.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The General Directorate of Health Services and the Ministry of Public Health have taken the necessary measures with the dispatch of medical brigades to combat the new epidemic outbreak, which has already caused countless deaths and decimated the child population.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In April of this year, an outbreak of this febrile illness caused the deaths of at least 150 children in the western region, primarily in villages of Quezaltenango and San Marcos.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Authorities explain that the increased number of deaths is due to the unusual fact that indigenous people have opposed immunizing children with vaccines and other endemic childhood illnesses for more than four years.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **Farmer leader calls for serenity and sanity**

  TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS, June 26, 75 (FOR LA CRONICA).— Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras, where the President of the National Association of Farmers of Honduras (ANACH), Reyes Rodriguez Arevalo, has asked the farmers for prudence and serenity to avoid a useless bloodshed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He made this invocation following the death of four peasants in an encounter with soldiers on Wednesday in the town of Juticalpa.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The deaths of these four peasants occurred inside a school, when they refused to leave. The school was occupied by peasants demanding land.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The ANACH President himself added that our organization has not had any agreement with the farmers who took over that educational center, and that, on the contrary, they have decided to fulfill all the legal requirements to obtain land.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Honduran newspapers report on these events, showing photographs of how this land demand movement unfolded.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **What should we men who work the land do for the revolution?**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Chajrapi llanqay runakuna imatan ruwananchis revolution rayku_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  On Farmers' Day, the Ministers spoke truthfully about the progress of Agrarian Reform. On that occasion, we heard again about how we've been advancing, already quite far and with snail's pace.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now, we men who work the land have to lend a hand so that Agrarian Reform can advance even further.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  First, since the land is now in our hands. Since the land has already returned to us, since our language has now been officially recognized, just like Spanish, we must give our strength, all our strength, so that the Agrarian Reform can be consolidated without concessions. So that it can continue to advance, thinking about itself, so that it can be deeply rooted in the urgent needs of the people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  And after all that, with true joy, putting forth our energies, cultivating our intelligence, working tirelessly, with our feet and hands, we must make the earth germinate with our greatest enthusiasm, with a true heart.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Agricultural production must increase so that it reaches all Peruvians—women and men, children, and the elderly. Everyone must have the right to the products of the land. There can be NO hunger. Nor can we allow humanity to suffer because of us.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There can be no true Agrarian Reform if we who work the land don't work with true conviction and responsibility. Agrarian Reform is in our hands. Now more than ever, Agrarian Reform rests in our hands. It rests only in us. In our strength, in our intentions, in our work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this reason, the Ministers have said: Men who work the land, produce even more of the fruits of the earth. All the peoples of Peru are looking to you, listening to these words. Strengthening ourselves as one, thinking of our people, with one voice and one hand, we must speak out.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We men who work the land will sow hearts as if they were seeds, we will bury the seeds with the hands of men, of men, so that everyone has potatoes, beans, corn, cassava, so that the products may abound.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That's what it means to be revolutionary: To uphold all our words with our actions, with our hands, with our sweat. To raise our flag with our arms, with our hearts.
