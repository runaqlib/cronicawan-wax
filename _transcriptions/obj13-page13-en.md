  KENNET PATCHEN The hounds, they look like sad old judges in a strange court. They point their noses at the black man who writhes inside the noose, his feet spread like crows on these honorable men who laugh while he suffocates. I don't know this black man I don't know these white men But I know that one hand of mine is black and the other is white I know that part of me is strangled while the other part laughs horribly Until all this changes I will not stop killing and being killed.

  One moonlit night, clear and diaphanous, Ch'uya Uma left his rooms, guided by the conjuring of strange and disconcerting voices that preceded a singular storm of zigzagging rays that dominated the Hill of Condor. Under the weight of unreality, he headed towards the bastion of Khipu Wasi, where he was stunned by the meteoric descent of a gigantic bolide that, dazzling and thundering across the Andean peaks, fell next to the distant Torreön Central. The haunting phenomenon kept him depressed all night, and as the soft dawn kissed his forehead, he discovered a monolithic sphere of smooth rock polished at the base with a wonderful jewel set in granite exquisitely tattooed from the middle up. Upon touching the filigree of its beautiful and perfect figures, he prostrated himself in ecstasy and with mysticism never felt before, he gave himself up to prayer, invoked with all the power of his spirit the help and mercy of God the Sun, and, with burning tears, he thanked the extraordinary ae rheolithic message of the Supreme Creator. From that night for Ch'uya Uma, the monolith of Saywite became his only and great goddess relic. It was the message from Pachscamac, to whom he gave his Indian love. His holy book. The powerful source of inspiration, and Olympus of his deity, where he immersed himself in deep meditation. He consecrated himself in it; the Law of working for an ideal; e well with a single purpose: the prosperity of all, with a single aspiration: the greatness of the community In the delicate profiles of high zoomorphic reliefs and arabesques of the tutelary number of the race, Ch'uya Uma discovered the secret symbols and the unfathomable mysteries of the flora and fauna of the FOUR HIS, discovered
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the message he saw lush megalithic fields with all their charms, he tried to auscultate the extraordinary furrows that seemed like new irrigation canals, he enjoyed admiring the terraces that hinted at steep lands that could be converted into platforms for the anxious man of the agricultural field. Many weeks were spent contemplating the regal palaces, terraced fortresses and miniature bastions, which shine with perfection of lines and overall harmony. It was truly a supernatural work, and a true treasure, that divine ciborium of sculpted rock. The poem of the race engraved in rock, the idyll of the Quechua man with the strong and harsh nature was and will be the telluric gospel of the Children of the Sun. The stone message became * a reliquary of wise doctrine of love and work, and not only served as a guideline for the natural sciences, it was also a standard for the art of life; The engineers, like the virtuosos of medicine, found in the fine profiles of the fabulous granite the master lines to perfectly capture the lines of the portentous platforms for orchards and incredible gardens, canals to quench the thirst of the barren fields and the royal roads that materially changed the face of its fierce land or magically beautified the flowery landscape of its ravines and punas, combining love and work, for the well-being and happiness of his people. And the kingdom took off towards the Empire of the FOUR HIS, which due to the magnificent government and exemplary administration of the Wiracoches of the Qosqo the Quechua was about to completely cover South America. Ch'uya Uma fulfilled her destiny, her material forms and her work to MOTHER EARTH
