  **SUNQU SUNQULLA TAKIQKUNAWAN**
  
  _FROM HEART TO HEART WITH_THE. FOLKLORE
  
  Like an invisible dog, the fog bit us with sadness. One Sunday, with the memory of Cusco in our hearts, it hurt more than all the plazas in the strange and vast city of Lima. But even so, we had to fulfill the day's mission: Go to the Coliseum. Listen, speak, and break down, to the same footwork and alongside the same ayñu. The afternoon, like an ocean liner, slowly bid farewell to the plazas. When we arrived near the National Coliseum, a loud aylas pulverized the roar of the cars. Provincials with semi-happy faces milled around the Colisco ticket booths on Bolivar Avenue. Inside, the spectacle was even more jovial; people laughed and applauded. It seemed as if the ayñu moved them through and through, shaking their marrow and bones. A dark memory of my homeland came riding in a Tejanchito Huanca ayñu, like a sapling filled with trills. I joined the crowd's jubilation, forgetting about the commission. The afternoon faded away in a trail of applause. In the dressing rooms, voices and people clashed. Iclicitas Becerra Carpio's laughter sowed dew in my soul. Her attire indicated that she would soon be on stage. I signaled my companion Montoro to print the first plates, and I fired off the first question:
  
  CRONICAWAN: HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN FOLK SONG? FELICITAS BECLRRA CARPIO: Well, I've been cultivating Huancayo folk music since I was 12, actually since school, here in Lima. But since 1970 I entered the coliseums, starting at the Puente del Ejército Coliseum, later signing a contract with businessman César Gallegos, and continuing to this coliseum to this day. My artist name is "Mantarina del Centro". CRONICAWAN: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? MANTARINA DEL CENTRO: I am from Lima, originally from Santiago de Surco, but I have always had a predilection for Huancayo music.
  
  CRONICAWAN: WHAT WAS YOUR GREATEST TRIUMPH IN YOUR ARTISTIC LIFE? MANTARINA DEL CENTRO: In addition to the applause from my audiences at the coliseums where I performed, I was very happy when I was promoted to the SONO RADIO record label, where I recorded two 45 RPM records. CRONICAWAN: HAVE YOU HAD ANY DISAPPOINTMENTS IN YOUR ARTISTIC LIFE? MANTARINA DEL CENTRO: Well, none to date. CRONICAWAN: WHICH NATIONAL ARTIST DO YOU ADMIRE? MANTARINA DEL CENTRO: Logically, the late artist Picaflor de los Andes. CRONICAWAN: WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE SONGS? MANTARINA DEL CENTRO: The mulizas "I will always remember you" and "Your contempt" Later in the same Coliseum we interviewed the director of the Estrella Andina Company of Huancayo, Teofila Fernández de Espinoza, known in the artistic environment as "Flor de Colca" we also asked: CRONICAWAN: HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN ART? FLOR DE COLCA: I started at the Santa Rosa de Ocopa Company, about fifteen years ago. CRONICAWAN: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? FLOR DE COLCA: I am from the town of Puquio, but I identify with Huancayo folklore, currently working for a long time in the company of César Gallegos. CRONICAWAN: WHAT WAS YOUR BEST TRIUMPH IN YOUR ARTISTIC LIFE? FLOR DE COLCA: Triumph, no triumph, but satisfactions in our tours. CRONICAWAN: WHICH NATIONAL ARTIST DO YOU ADMIRE? YOU? FLOR DE COLCA: To the Hummingbird of the Andes. CRONICAWAN: WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE SONGS? FLOR DE COLCA: What I like most about my repertoire is the huaylas "Vikicina ambla" It was our pleasure to interview a child folk artist, his name is Edvin Acón Rojas, baptized with the artistic name of "Tejanchito Huanca godson of Hummingbird of the Andes.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Tejanchito, tell us about your career and especially your foray into the artistic life here at the coliseum. TEJANCHITO HUANCA. - I was born in Huancayo and have been singing the huaylas since I was three years old, winning an award here in Lima at the House of Culture, where I appeared on a folkloric program, which was very popular with the audience. Later, I appeared on El Mundo de los Niños (Children's World) on a local television station, and then moved on to the coliseums, especially this one, the Coliseo Nacional. I currently study here in Lima, in the district of San Isidro, thanks to a scholarship from the municipality. I'm currently in second grade. However, I live with my parents in Villa El Salvador. That's all I can tell you. This is how Edin, a seven-year-old boy who has already participated in folkloric life, spoke to us. Likewise, with the same objective that prompted us to visit the Coliseo Nacional, we interviewed the members of the Centro Musical Vulkano Cerreño, whose director is Don Toribio Salazar Rivera. CRONICAWAN. - Don Toribio, how did you get started in this art? TORIBIO SALAZAR. - I have been cultivating Cerreño folklore since 1949, and it is more than that, it is the folklore of the mine workers. CRONICAWAN: Where do you come from? TORIBIO SALAZAR: I am originally from the same city of Cerro de Pasco. CRONICAWAN: What was your greatest triumph in your artistic life? TORIBIO SALAZAR: Well, for me in particular it was the one you achieved in a National Folklore Contest, held at the Coliseo Cerrado back in 1959, and I also have 12 albums to my credit, all of them dedicated to the Cerreño land. CRONICAWAN: Have you had any disappointments in your artistic career? TORIBIO SALAZAR: Yes, indeed, it has been a great pain for me, with the loss of my son in 1971, also a member of our folkloric group and also the reason why I persist in singing to my people, to whom I owe myself. CRONICAWAN: Which national artist do you admire? TORIBO SALAZAR: Undoubtedly the Hummingbird of the Andes.
  
  CRONICAWAN: (What are your favorite songs? TORIBIO SALAZAR: My favorite song is the muliza "Aguas de pata gocha." Please add that the vocalists of my group are: Carmelo Valdez, known as Guardián Cerreño and Juan Ventura. The world of the coliseum is infinite, its nuances swirl, they are vortices of passion, nostalgia and memories swirl with its ancient aroma of freshly wet earth, with its invitation to life. The ayñus of the diverse regions of deep Peru, jadcan, become light on the stage. They tint the gases of the fog with remembrances, they leave memories that are always musty, always transitive of the distant, they are formless analgesics for the anguish of memory. When we leave the coliseum, something like an unforgiving question resists emerging from the throat. The spotlights make the fog more indecisive, we think about what all of them have answered us: "The National Institute of Culture, must also promote folk music, must encourage vernacular artists." We think of the poverty of the people who, Sunday after Sunday, yearn, suffer, cry out and demand from the staves of their ayñus, from their sadness as neglected provincials, from that infinite slowness of distance that looms behind every provincial heart.
