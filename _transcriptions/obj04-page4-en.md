  **### Mozambique achieves its freedom**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Mozambique, aypanqa qispiriyninta*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  LORENZO MARQUEZ, June 1975 (From our services).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Lorenzo Marquez is the capital of Mozambique.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Mozambique is located on the east coast of Africa, has an area of 785,000 square kilometers and about 7 million inhabitants.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For many years, Mozambicans have been waging a war against the colonialist forces of Portugal to obtain their independence.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Fortunately, on April 25, 1974, the Portuguese Armed Forces started a revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The new Portuguese rulers understood that there is no force in the world capable of defeating and bending the will of the people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  As a result, they began talks with the Mozambican groups fighting for their independence and reached an agreement to decolonize Mozambique.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Therefore, from these days onwards a new nation will be created, the Republic of Mozambique.

  All the countries of the world are gathered in the so-called United Nations Organization (UN).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In that UN, there is an organization called the Program
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This organization is looking into ways of assisting the governments of Bolivia, Chile and Peru in developing plans to enable vast desert areas that were once cultivated to be used for agricultural purposes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  UNDP seeks to provide assistance to developing countries by helping to train the technicians of the future.
  
  **### Eustaquio Maylle declares in Havana**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Havana llaqtapi, Eustaquio Maylle rimarin*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Havana, June 1975. (Prensa Latina).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Eustaquio Maylle, President of the National Agrarian Confederation of Peru, in statements to journalists said:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  All of us who are here in Cuba have met our brothers from Cuba and have traveled around this country getting to know it.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We have been to all the places, we have learned their stories, all their struggles. We have learned about the struggles of our brother Fidel Castro. We too have fought hard for the Peruvian Revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I wish that all my brothers, all the peasants, all the workers, would come to a single agreement, like here in Cuba, so that we can make a new life flourish, build the New Society.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Eustaquio Maylle then said: The National Agrarian Confederation brings together more than 4 million farmers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This unity is now possible in Peru, thanks to the existence of a new policy. All the peasants, the workers, those of us who were despised for a long time, those of us who were forgotten, are now united by this new policy.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Since we are men, from a single country, we must also speak our own language, that is why the Revolutionary Government of Juan Velasco Alvarado, has made Runa Simi official, with it everything that we had forgotten for many years, with our language we will now recover.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now doctors, lawyers, engineers will speak this language. All peasants speak this language, since it is their language. This law will help all Peruvians to unite as if we were one, to find a better future.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Eustaquio Maylle also said: On June 7, we took a single oath, the Armed Forces, all the people and President Juan Velasco Alvarado, to be one union, one force. Here in Cuba, I cannot forget that.
  
  **US government accused**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *USA kamachiqtan ch'atanku*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  KINSHASA, ZAIRE, June 1975 (From our services).- Zaire is located on the African continent and has an area of 2,340,000 square kilometers. Zaire produces mainly diamonds, gold and copper.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Zaire government has accused the US and its leaders of attempting to assassinate President Mobutu Sese Seko and stage a coup.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  President Mohutu himself confirmed this when he announced that some military personnel involved in the plot had been arrested.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This shows once again that the CIA is willing to commit the most horrific crimes in order to achieve its goals.
  
  **With these hands**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Kay makiwanmi*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These hands cultivated the land. Buried in the snow, in the stones or in the water, these hands multiplied the seeds.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The blood of these hands quenched the thirst of the earth, only these hands defeated the hardest fatigue.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The landowners became rich through the work of these hands. They are hands shaped by fire, which grasped all the disdain and crushed all the impossibles.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These hands are working hands, like precise furrows thirsty for life, like burning sand that is edged with blood and rejoices. These hands buried life and death in their wrinkles: In this land, on this land, within this land, only these hands, only these hands were clenched for the cause of man.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These hands have discovered the secrets, deciphered the enigmas and the keys. However, how many things these hands do not know, what paths these hands did not save, what thorny settlers did not pull from their forges. Only these hands collected and accumulated their tears.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Let us never, ever forget these hands. These hands are the hands of the people. These hands are the hands of the poor. These hands suffered and cried against the wind and against the fire. The truth only fits in these hands, only these hands know the truth.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These tired hands raised the beauty of the people. These hands will bury the fires with their shadow, only these hands drowned in errors, only these hands invented errors. (AA).
