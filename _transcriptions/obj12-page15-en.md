  **OF THOSE WHO WORKED IN CLAY**
  
  
  
  They didn't just want mud to plaster the walls of their houses. The plastering of houses came much later. In the preterite, they made caves their homes; it was only later that they learned to build their temples.
  
  
  
  Here we're not just going to talk about that original, wild clay. Clay was worked primarily to make bowls, to mold pots, and to make vessels. It's still unknown which people began working with clay, but it is certain that those who worked with clay must have had a developed intelligence. Those who know tell us that perhaps they began working in Ecuador or Colombia, and from those places it spread to us. Those people began working with clay in ancient times.

  **HOW MEN HAD LAND**
  
  
  
  By cultivating their lands and multiplying their livestock, our fellow human beings also increased their numbers. Thus, they began to farm on a large scale and raise livestock in large numbers. Living in this way, they built houses to guard their farms. They say that in the town of Chilca, they found this housing arrangement. This is what Professor Luis Lumbreras tells us. During the time we are speaking of, landowners appeared. In the past, men owned no property; no land, no farms; only the fruits of the earth belonged to them, only the animals they hunted. But, from the time the land began to be sown, by the very fact of living
  
  
  
  From the fruits of their sowing, the land belonged to them all (of course, the land was not individual property; it belonged to everyone). That land was defended from outsiders because they viewed it as their own. This fact advanced men from their savage state; it gave them knowledge and awareness in their lives. Speaking even more, we can say that men lived under the command of a supreme chief. That life was like that of beasts. There was a chief there, the strongest, the most skilled hunter. Because of his strength, he commanded all men. From that situation, a communal organization evolved. In that way of life, strongmen did not command; rather, sensible and/or judicious men ruled. They ordered in consultation with each other. That way of life led men to the Ayllu, where we find the roots of today's people. (whdems)

  **WHAT MEN WEAVE**
  
  
  
  Cultivation of the land made it possible for humans to live in one place. This is how humans learned to build their villages. Living this way, humans acquired a great deal of knowledge—without exaggerating too much, we can say they acquired new knowledge every day, and with this, they consolidated their life on earth. Among this knowledge is the beginning of the art of weaving. They say that in ancient times they were able to weave with tree fibers, then they wove by drying the Chuchaw (maguey). They say they were able to weave baskets from rushes. It was the fishermen who made the most use of it; they wove nets to fish. From then on, they were able to catch fish in greater quantities, no longer one at a time as they did with a hook. Rather, they were able to catch fish in large quantities. Over many years, humans learned to weave. But even then, they still didn't weave for clothing. When they discovered cotton and learned about animal wool, they were finally able to weave for warmth. As experts say, this type of weaving still lacked a weft and a thread. As she knitted, her hands also became skillful.
