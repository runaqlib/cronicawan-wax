  **TRULY DAWNED PERUVIAN CINEMA**
  
  
  
  From now on, CINE-PERU will rise in our Peruvian people. It will make what we say: films. So that people from all over the world can watch these films. CINE-PERU will carefully monitor whether these films are well thought out or not. It will also assess the quality of the films. Even now, the films we watch are only looking to make a lot of money; they don't see the point.
  
  
  
  instructive, nor do they contain any message. Instead, today, with Law 21244, we will seek to teach the people of all nations what is being done in our Peru, as well as what is being done on earth. So as not to see only fights, so as not to continue contemplating the private parts of men and women. Now we will see what the people know and we will also discover the knowledge of other nations. For all this, CINE PERU was born.

  **EPSA IS CONSOLIDATED**
  
  
  
  Food Minister Rafael Hoyos Rubio has ordered those who sell EPSA food items to organize in our town. To accomplish this task, it has been arranged that food items will be transported by cart to the sales stands. This will be the case at Super-EPSA stands; additional food items will be supplied to ensure that there are no shortages, thereby ensuring that no stand lacks basic necessities. Currently, the food items are being transported in four carts carrying 20 tons of basic necessities. It has also been announced that this fleet will be expanded with four more carts, bringing the total to 40 tons of food items.

  **SCIENCE RADIO SPECIALIST**
  
  
  
  With the words of the Minister of Education Ramón Miranda Ampuero,
  
  
  
  The XVIII General Assembly of the International Union of Radio Science began here in the city of Lima. His words were an exhortation to extend his knowledge to all the poor countries that are subjected, so that they can bring about a better life. This great meeting was inaugurated on Monday the 11th. 400 scientists are invited to this meeting, so that their science may be at the service of liberation, and that their knowledge may not serve the interests of the
  
  
  
  imperialist nations, because they are the ones who starve and bring suffering to the poor countries of the world, using their strength and power.

  **They are looking for ways to help the miners.**
  
  
  
  The directors of the Mining Bank of Peru are currently considering ways to financially assist the mining company "Condor" Cata Catari, "Cobrepampa", "Cobre SRL", so that they can continue working. In order for the Revolutionary Government to become effective last Tuesday, it ordered, through two laws, that 30 million soles be allocated for that purpose. Thus, the Ministry of Energy and Mines has sent three delegates to jointly discuss with the directors of the Mining Bank the reasonable aid they will provide. 600 miners who work for the "Condor" mining company are coming to the city of Lima to ask the President for help; they are already at the Cañete River.
