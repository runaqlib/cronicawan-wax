  _THE PASSAGE OF OUR SOLDIERS_
  
  In what is considered their most complete demonstration of power and discipline, the Armed Forces and Police Forces performed before an audience that applauded them enthusiastically on the traditional stage of Avenida Brasil. The traditional Military Parade and Parade commemorating the 154th Anniversary of National Independence was presided over by the President of the Republic, Major General Juan Velasco Alvarado. A jubilant and compact crowd covered practically the entire thirty blocks of Avenida Brasil. The mobilization of the people began in the early hours of the morning. The temporary stands erected along the parade stage were filled with publicity, as were buildings and private homes. Around 10:45 a.m., President Velasco appeared on Avenida Brasil in full dress uniform and in an open car, accompanied by the Prime Minister and Minister of War, General Francisco Morales Bermúdez, and the head of the Military Household, General Enrique Ibáñez Burga.
  
  On his way to the official platform, located in the Ovalo de Pueblo Libre, at the 23rd block of Brasa Avenue, President Velasco received the fraternal and revolutionary greetings of the people. Moments before the parade began, cadets from the Armed Forces and Police Forces raised the National Flag to the strains of the March of Flags. The Republican Guard Band then played the National Anthem and the Anthem of the Revolution. Following this, the Chief of the Line, Leonidas Rodriguez Figueroa, advanced toward President Velasco, requesting permission to begin the procession. The parade and military parade began at 11:00 a.m., with the opportunity for the marching of eight military groups from the Armed Forces and Police Forces, culminating two hours later.

  The Sugar Cooperatives of Peru (CECOAAP) applauds the decision of the Revolutionary Government to integrate the cooperatives into the Social Property sector.
  
  Agrarian, SAIS, and Native Communities, announced by President Juan Velasco Alvarado in his National Holiday message. The president of this association, Jalme Escobal, expressed his full support for this formula proposed by our leader and leader of the Peruvian Revolution, as it is of transcendental and historic importance to Peruvian agriculture and its revolutionary process. He also stated in a press release that the government has provided further proof of the participatory nature fostered by the Revolutionary Government, embracing the proposals emerging from the cooperative grassroots. He also added in this statement, "The consolidation of the Social Property Sector will allow us, agrarian cooperative members, especially sugar producers, to address or concretize our proposals expressed in the Trujillo Declaration, when we speak of compensation mechanisms that will allow us to spread positive effects to a sector where the revolutionary philosophy is expressed." He also states that emerging Socul-owned enterprises, along with restructured peasant communities, SAIS, and CAPs, will make the social sector dynamic and real.

  _FOR OUR PEOPLE_WITH ENERGETIC STEP.
  
  Lima and the entire Peruvian people thrilled yesterday to the gallant and martial march of the students. Dressed in their unique uniforms, the students once again paid their patriotic tribute to their homeland. With a firm and confident step, the men of tomorrow's Peru filled the main squares of the districts within their jurisdictions with martial spirit and patriotism. Of special note was the school parade in the Self-Managed Community of Villa El Salvador (CUAVES), which displayed pride and love for their country. The marching bands, many of them made up of female students, marked the march of the young people, playing their school anthem or the traditional Flag March. Some schools marched accompanied by motorcycle units or Hussar Ranger regiments, to the admiration of the audience, who rewarded them with standing ovations. The youngest students marched, mostly representing the Heroes of Independence, thus changing the dreary atmosphere of Greater Lima. It is also worth noting that hundreds of vehicles remained stuck for almost four hours in the areas surrounding the parades.

  _THE CHRONICLE IS FROM THE_PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC
  
  As of August 1, the newspaper LA CRONICA reports directly to the Presidency of the Republic. This was stated by Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada, Director of LA CRONICA, in a meeting held in the LA CRONICA Newsroom. On this occasion, our Director stated that the objectives of the Revolution are the objectives of the newspaper. In this regard, he added, the LA CRONICA Command expects the full and responsible participation of the newspaper's employees. We look forward, he said, to criticisms and suggestions aimed at improving the newspaper. Likewise, you will be informed of the company's situation in all its aspects, the Director emphasized. "It is necessary to deny some irresponsible and malicious rumors that have been circulating. There are those who are spreading the rumor that the newspaper's Command is going to lay off a large number of workers, and that," he stated in an energetic tone, "is totally false. If someone has to leave the newspaper, it will be because they are idle and do not fulfill their obligations, in the way that all of you do. Likewise, those who seek to drag us into positions other than those of the revolution will leave the newspaper, or those who simply want to leave." Then, our Director said: "Now I want to introduce you to Dr. Carlos Quiroga, who from now on will take over as Editor-in-Chief. Likewise, Reynaldo Naranjo will occupy the position of Journalistic Advisor to the Senior Management, - he noted immediately - I ask for your fullest cooperation with them." "In order to expand the Newsroom, so that you can work in a more spacious environment, a team of engineers will be coming to carry out the necessary studies. They will come pro bono, and there are many men like them in our country, who work in many places without pay, but some don't understand this and launch disloyal attacks at us, but it's not worth responding." These were the statements made by Dr. Gonzales Posada to the newspaper's employees, on the occasion of the announcement of LA CRONICA's transfer directly to the Presidency of the Republic.

  _UNIVERSITY OF CUSCO_ELABORATE QESWA PHONEME.
  
  A scientific phonetic scheme and a graphic system that leads to the formulation of a unique alphabet for the Quechua language were proposed by Dr. Franklin Rodho Salas, a historian and Quechuologist from Cusco, regarding the officialization of Runa Simi and its mandatory teaching in the country. In this regard, Dr. Rodho proposed the application of the Qesa Alphabet composed of 31 phonemes and a globalization sign, which was developed by a group of scholars from the University of "San Antonio Abao del Cusco and subsequently approved by the Interamerican Congress of Indigenists that took place in 1954 in La Paz, Bolivia. Now that the teaching of Quechua has been institutionalized and its inclusion within the school and academic curriculum, a law must be enacted that, overcomes particular interests and obsolete pronunciations of traditional Quechua speakers, imposes an official alphabet that overcomes the current difficulties of learning our language. He concluded, saying that the implementation of a single alphabet will bring with it an exact phonemicization for those who wish to learn it, as well as simplicity in its graphological writing, universality in its spelling, and above all, the permanence and security of Quechua.
