  _WORKING IN SOLIDARITY_GROW
  
  The Department of Puno extends over the Titicaca plateau. Its climate is cold, tempered in the lower reaches by the influence of the lake; at higher altitudes, the cold is glacial. Extensive mountain ranges surround the plateau. A howling, icy wind gallops across its vast solitudes. For centuries, sheep and men have experienced the same reality of frustration. The Pucara bull, molded in Santiago de Pupuja, and the endless and monotonous huaino (a gangster's dance) are the best-known cultural products of the Department of Puno. The faces of smiling Puno peasants have traveled the world on postcards. In reality, they are as impenetrable as a quartz statue. "Forged on the anvil of the Andean plateau," as Dante Nava said, the peasants of Puno
  
  Andean," as Dante Nava said, the peasants of Puno are too silent to smile every day. After six years of liberation and the music of freedom, they ruminate over each response, as if still facing the whip of the boss. They answer in monosyllables and their words have no taste, but when you speak to them about Velasco, a submerged light rises to their faces and they plot dreams and deeds only to fall silent as if held back by a brake. "utjapjajotua huanajama hua ucampyjamhua" (We lived worse than animals). We ended up memorizing the phrase from hearing it so often in different provinces of the Department of Puno. Aymara is a much more solid barrier than those built with andesite blocks. The peasants speak without betraying the slightest emotion: "Markajatua markajatua," they respond tirelessly. The Department of Puno, like a miniature Peru, belonged to 10 families: The Mendozas owned the estates of Molino, San Carlos, San Fernando, Coruna, and Imata, some 70,000 hectares. The Romañas owned the Picotani and Talla estates. The Irigoyens owned Toroya, Cora-Cora, Trapiche, and Ganadera del Sur SA. They grouped together 15 estates. The Muñoz-Najar and Salcedo families lived in Lima, Miami, and Paris. Only the administrators were responsible for overseeing and overwhelming the farmers. The administrators were loyal to their employers and even more loyal to their own pockets. The obligations fell to the farmers; the rest belonged to the landowners.
  
  AGRARIAN REFORMS:
  
  "The two previous agrarian reforms only served to further impoverish the peasants. The best cultivable areas were reserved for the local bosses, the rocky areas for the peasants. Both the law passed by Beluande's previous government and the one promulgated by this one clearly favored the hacienda owners." This speaker is Eng. Percy Aramayo, from Chalco. Law 15037, passed by Beluande, established that cultivated areas were unaffected. Under this provision, the landowners not only reserved for themselves what they already had, they snatched away the small plots from the settlers to expand their own. Thus, the peasants of the Azurini estate, owned by the Munoz Najars, were forced to occupy the estate's hills, abandoning their small fields, because the estate manager, Mario Zinzick, castrated peasants who disobeyed him. Those were times when a single man with the title of administrator ruled over lives and honors according to his own whim. "The administrator was screwed, very screwed," says one of the partners of the current Azurine production unit of SAIS Puno. With Law 17716, the Agrarian Reform Law, enacted by the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, the Department of Puno, like other vast rural regions of Peru, was reclaimed. For the first time in the history of our country, the land passed directly into the hands of those who work it. The poor of Peru received, without conditions of any kind, the furrows and water that are the reason for their existence.
  
  THE SAIS PUNO IN GENERAL PERSPECTIVES:
  
  On June 21st of this year, SAIS Puno will celebrate its second anniversary. The individuals and legal entities that make up the organization can speak of a true
  
  A brilliant battle has been fought in its organization, operation, and capitalization. It is not the best, but it is one of the unique peasant organizations that exists in the Department of Puno. Its dynamism, its fervent spirit, and its unwavering faith in the achievements of the Peruvian Revolution place it in an undeniable outpost. The SAIS Puno, comprises a large part of the province of Puno, Department of the same name. It belongs to the Agrarian Zone XII, to the PIAR of one, to the Agrarian Office of key. The total area is 61,000 hectares, at 4,050 meters above sea level. The award was made by Directorial Resolution No. 1404-73. DDRA-AR, of June 21, 1973. The number of members at the time of the award was 841, to date it continues with the same number of members. The main office is 11 kilometers from Puno, and much of its area is along the Puno-Moquegua highway. The individuals and legal entities comprising SAIS Puno are: the Service Cooperative, and the communities of Ccollakachi, Azurini, Sillamury, Aloja, Comata, and Ychupalla. All of these are livestock communities, except for Azurini, which is agricultural. The highest authority of SAIS Puno is the General Assembly, followed by the Board of Directors and the Oversight Committee. The current President of the Board of Directors is Enrique Choque. The Special Committees for Education, Agriculture, Livestock, and Marketing report directly to the Board of Directors. Management is headed by Engineer Humberto Centeno.
  
  AND THEY STARTED WALKING WITH ALMOST NOTHING.
  
  When the local bosses realized that the Revolutionary Government wouldn't compromise with them. When the haciendas began to be deeply affected, without confusion, when the peasants were granted ownership titles. The landowners began to decapitalize the haciendas; they didn't want to leave anything behind. Regardless of the age, breed, or condition of the animals, they were sold at ridiculous prices, given away, or slaughtered without any consideration. "Get rid of livestock capital before the impact" was the motto of all the caciques. Logically, all this happened in Viluyo, Ccollakachi, Aziruni, Oloja, etc. What would later become the SAIS Puno at the time of its impact only received cattle of degenerate breeds, exhausted pastures, and a completely abandoned infrastructure. Engineer Centeno tells us: "We only had the capacity to work, the will to do work, we had the arms of the peasants and an immense faith in the Peruvian Revolutionary process. If we were not animated by the ideals of change and transformation, we would have been able to do very little, there is in the peasants, enthusiasm, love for the land, a desire to learn the techniques of animal husbandry, as well as some deficiencies resulting from the servitude and oppression in which they lived. We received support and understanding from the Agrada XII area, each of our steps responds to a general plan whose main objective is to take the Department of Puno out of the backwardness and barbarism into which the former owners of this Department plunged it. Without believing in the Revolution
  
  There was very little we could have done. We're moving forward. We've already met the first goal of capitalization. Currently, SAIS Puno has 70,000 sheep, 4,000 cattle, and 7,000 alpacas—a total of approximately 100 million soles in cash, not including the infrastructure we've been building. We're building a cafeteria for the schoolchildren. We have six teachers hired, paid by SAIS Puno, along with a social worker, a nurse, and a doctor who visits once a week.
  
  WHEN THE NUMBERS SPEAK
  
  The owners of Hacienda Ccollakachi, according to estimates, had a record number of 25,000 sheep on their land. In the same area, SAIS Puno has 66,000 sheep, 4,000 cattle, and around 7,000 alpacas. The Muñoz Najar family, owners of these farms, had guaranteed profits with 25,000 sheep, since they hadn't invested in pastures, livestock improvement, or labor. At the time of its award, SAIS Puno started with a debt of 86,420,000 soles: for land, livestock, construction, machinery, etc. Plus the investment in livestock improvement totals about 100 million soles. The current capital available for sheep reduction is 130,000 head, not including annual harvests, which, when reduced to 100 million soles. "We have capitalized, and that is the first major step taken by SAIS Puno," asserts Engineer Centeno. SAIS Puno has increased its percentage of pregnant women to such an extent that it is assured of a higher birth rate for this year. The cooperative members have evidence that they will pay off their debt to the state ahead of schedule. Regarding infrastructure: They have a supply of basic necessities. Housing for the company's technical staff. Five teachers in Ccollakachi, three in Viluyo, one vocational education teacher, and two preschool teachers. One hundred and fifty students are enrolled in Ccollakachi and fifty in Viluyo. A cafeteria for students serves breakfast and lunch. Breakfast consists of a cup of oatmeal with milk and two rolls of bread; lunch consists of two bowls of soup with meat and salads, and a meat-based stew is prepared twice a week. SAIS Puno distributes teaching and learning materials to the children of the beneficiaries. They have a nurse residing at the SAIS headquarters, and a doctor visits twice a week. This year, the construction of the SAIS Puno Educational Complex should be completed. This complex will house all the schools located in the communities that comprise the SAIS. Furthermore, students will be considered boarders and will receive food and lodging at the complex, without parents having to pay for these services. Would all this have been possible if the landowners had continued? Isn't there evidence of a profound transformation in both the provision of services and the attitude of farmers? With respect to the land tenure systems prior to 1968, is there or is there not a change? These are questions that the detractors of the Revolutionary Process should have taken into account before their stubborn opposition.
  
  THE LUMINOUS BATTLE
  
  SAIS Puno has begun to move forward with a firm footing, without much noise. The peasants no longer see everything as alien and distant; they look to the horizons of the high plateau and now find a place for their dreams and their lives. Forced reverence no longer exists; all paths lead to integration, to mutual aid, to collective sharing. The peasants of SAIS Puno and throughout the Titicaca Plateau work and build for today and for their children. Throughout all the interviews held with peasants, with technicians, with SAIS Puno employees, we have asked ourselves with fear and reproach: What sustains them in such difficult wildernesses? The peasants were born in those highest corners of the homeland. They are accustomed to that solitude; from parents and children, they only know how to herd sheep and wounds; they know only the time of the huainos and remembrances, and a time that seemed endless, "the time of contempt." Now a new glow shines in their eyes, they feel a joy rising in their steps, they lift their hearts to the wind of freedom that sweeps across the homeland. They know they are masters of the land, responsible for their actions, lords and masters of their destinies and their future. The land roots them to these lands; the bleating of their sheep surrounds them with ancient rituals, stories, and chirping unknown to the men of the cities. For them, the reason for their lives is the reason for their lands, their alpacas, and their sheep. The farmers of SAIS Puno and all the farmers of Peru dedicate themselves in spirit and courage, in dreams and strength to this new reality that Peru is experiencing. And the technicians, who left the big city to go work in those areas, "those who make the revolution, without proposing many theories" -- as Eng. Conteno, Administrator of SAIS Puno, said. Engineers like Percy Aramayo and David Núñez "First comes our commitment to our people, to the revolution, then our comfort" -- as they expressed when interviewed. Doctors like Luis Molina, living on the shores of the lake, born and reborn alongside the peasants, working with them and for them with a simple and profound joy, turning Peru from tears to the Homeland of Liberty and joy that we all dream of.
  
  SAIS Puno is a model not only for having been one of the first to be capitalized, but also for the euphoria of revolution it experiences, and even for the contradiction between technicians and peasants, for the struggles between the various levels of peasants. For the still unresolved problem of the "huacchos," for the accumulation of problems and realities they have to confront every day, it is a model, above all: because it is a resounding lie, a clear demonstration that properly oriented agrarian cooperatives, managed with priority, are a complete, conclusive, and unchallengeable success. The peasant Lorenzo Alcca, 54 years old, told us, with the ancient wisdom of his people: "...before it was terrible, everything happened, our cattle were not our cattle, we alone were to blame for everything, our huts were not even good for resting, we lived listening to the trot of the farm manager, there was no end to the abuses, shepherds like me, the biggest sheepherders in the world, have suffered, why would the landowner return? There would be another lake of blood, no landowner, no foreman, another lake of blood would be born."
