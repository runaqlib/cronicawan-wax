  _WAMINK'A FERNANDEZ MALDONADO SAMINCHAN PROPERTY SOCIALTAN_
  
  **Fernandez Maldoado Exalts Social Ownership**
  
  Social Property is nourished by the "purest and most ancient humanistic socialism that lives and survives in the depths of man and is a heritage of our past history and certainly the beautiful and bright future of humanity," said the Minister of Energy and Mines, General Jorge Fernández Maldonado, yesterday.
  
  It was at the inauguration of the First Training Seminar on Social Ownership in the Energy and Mining Sector in a ceremony held in the Potro Perú auditorium.
  
  Fernández Maldonado also stated that our entire society will be a true community of workers, a reality and not just a vanished dream in the minds and hearts of all Peruvians.
  
  He added that "the entire Peru will be a gigantic Socially Owned Enterprise, free from individual or group selfishness, overcoming, in the deepest part of our conscience and subjectivity, those factors that disrupt the objective nature of the immense social transformations we are achieving with so much effort and sacrifice."
  
  The first speaker at the seminar was General Arturo Valdés Palacios, Deputy Chief of the COAP (National Council of Public Works), who urged public officials and professionals to collaborate in the preparation of project studies for Socially Owned Enterprises, thereby achieving considerable savings, since consulting firms charge large sums of money to conduct these studies.

  Lime.
  
  Dear Sir,
  
  With affection that springs from my heart, and greeting you with this letter, I send you my fortunate embrace for the publication of the newspaper CRONICAWAN written in Quechua on June 3rd.
  
  As I come to this day, I am very happy to send you my words in this rich language that resonated in the voices of the Incas, and that opened like flowers in the voices of their women.
  
  The value of strength comes from unity, and so, all of us gathered in Peru will spread our language to the entire universe.
  
  Receive these words that emerge from my heart, because, like you, I would like to work for the greater glorification of our Quechua in this immense Peru. We will all work without rancor, helping each other so that it may spread to every corner.
  
  May the guardian gods grant that, in this house where thought is born, all may be united by the same warmth, by the same fraternal experience; so that all of Peru may gain greater vigor, and at the same time the peoples of the world may salute its greatness.
  
  My lord, please accept this faithful love, and extend it to those who share your joy. I look forward to joyfully fulfilling your orders.
  
  For 400 years now, this Inca people has been suffering its pain. From today and into the future, the soul of our land and our language will be reborn to a new life.
  
  May our people grow and remain respected.
  
  
  
  
  
  Victor Raúl Acuña Loniza.

  **Cerro de Pasco CPAs Will Help Communities**
  
  The Cerro de Pasco Agrarian Cooperatives will provide economic training to help organize rural communities that have not benefited from the Agrarian Reform, according to Elías Estrella Niño, President of the Cerro de Pasco Agrarian Federation.
  
  This leader made this statement at the end of a meeting of the National Agrarian Confederation, of which his Federation is a member, once again emphasizing his call to the Agrarian Production Cooperatives, which are well-funded and have millions of dollars.
  
  He also pointed out that some 87 peasant communities lack the financial resources and means to improve their lives. This is in contrast to the peasant cooperatives, which are well organized thanks to the agrarian reform.
  
  In order to promote rural communities, the Agrarian Federation is asking cooperatives to extend their financial support, as requested by leader Estrella Niño.
  
  He added that this proposal was even approved by the Central Cooperatives Association, which brings together 23 agricultural cooperatives.
  
  Consequently, the approval of the Agrarian Leagues of the Daniel Alcides Carrión Provinces, “Chaupi. Huaranga”, “José Carlos Mariátegui”, “Juan Santos. Atahualpa” League, of Oxapampa, and the “Mártires de Rancas and Uchumarca” is expected.
  
  Likewise, the leader, Elías Estrella, added that the Agrarian Federation is calling for better distribution of fertilizers, with oversight by FERTISA, ENCI, and the Agrarian Federation.
  
  With these concerns being heard, they will be harvesting very good products such as potatoes, corn, etc.

  **Third World Quote**
  
  Eight hundred delegates from 75 developing countries will participate in the upcoming Conference of Foreign Ministers of Underdeveloped Countries, which will meet in Lima from August 23 to 29.
  
  This conference will address the major issues affecting Third World countries, such as the issue of raw materials and their prices, and our resulting economic independence.
  
  By recently issued Supreme Decree, this Conference has been deemed a national priority, as a demonstration of the importance given to the Third World Conference, as it will contribute to a better understanding of the Peruvian Process and its Revolutionary Government.
  
  Sixteen countries, including our country and their respective delegates, will meet prior to the Conference to outline the agenda for this international event.
  
  It is only recently that it is attracting the attention of highly industrialized countries, due to the awakening of underdeveloped countries.
  
  The event will be held at the Crillón Hotel, and arrangements have already been made to provide our guests with the necessary amenities.

  **Small regulated property**
  
  The Revolutionary Government enacted the law regulating small property, through the approval of Supreme Decree 21166, for all farmers who use their farmland and have irrigation canals. This will be enforced in the mountains and jungle areas.
  
  This law will regulate farmers in the provinces of Lima, Carabaya, Sandia, La Unión, Caravelí, Condesuyos, Castilla, Calilloma, Islay, Camaná, and Arequipa, allowing them to use land for a maximum of 30 hectares.
  
  
  
  
  
  This law also specifies that if the Agrarian Reform affects these properties, it will respect the farmland, including their homes, for a maximum of $100 hectares; it also stipulates that "they must reside on said property permanently without receiving any other income from jobs, professions, etc., unrelated to agriculture."

  **The tenancy law is going to be passed.**
  
  Eviction trials have already been cut short.
  
  In cases other than lack of rent or single-family homes, the Revolutionary Government has decreed the immediate suspension of eviction proceedings, except for those specified, until the enactment of the Tenancy Law.
  
  In the event that eviction proceedings are for reasons that the owner of the property requires because it is a single-family home or the tenant does not comply with the conductive mercy, these will continue their course until the corresponding judge issues his ruling.
  
  The cutoff for these eviction trials will be enforced by Decree Law 21168 approved by the Council of Ministers.
  
  The decree also specifies that if the tenant is late in paying the conductive mercy, he will file a complaint with the judge for a ruling.
  
  With the enactment of the Tenancy Law, at least this critical problem our country has been facing will have been resolved.
  
  The Ministry of Housing has a say in the housing solution for the benefit of our people.
  
  
  
  
  
  _Kanpisinu Rune: Cronicawan_
  
  **Peasants and Cronicawan**
  
  Every day, Peruvian peasants directly contribute to shaping the history of our country. Through our participation, structural change is taking place; we contribute our strength and our thinking. Today, the government recognizes the Quechua language, and revolutionary journalists write a newspaper in our language. I feel proud to be a peasant of New Peru, said Emilio Endara, President of the “Rumi Maki” Agrarian Federation.
  
  An important meeting of the training committees of this Federation, which represents all agricultural workers, was recently held. At this meeting, the delegates from each of the Agrarian Leagues agreed to extend their congratulations and encouragement to the Editor of the new newspaper "CRONICAWAN" for fulfilling the eternal dream of farmers: having a spokesperson written by authentic Peruvians and in the language of our ancestors.
  
  The peasant leaders of the "Vicente Tinta Ccoa" League, in a display of simplicity and emotion, expressed that with this journalistic organ their children will learn not only to pronounce well but also to write.
  
  Later, they made it clear that in their upcoming training meetings, they will publish their agreements and achievements in their own language, because they know that this revolution truly belongs to the poor and forgotten peasants, who today sing our national anthem in the language of the Peruvian Andes.
