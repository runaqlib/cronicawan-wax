  _Haqnata llank'aspan cornica mit'alita sayarichiyku_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At about four in the morning, the printing press spins vertiginously, trembling, its power increases, it vibrates impetuously, the newspapers glide by, the ink still fresh, the black and red striking, the headlines vigorous, the photographs clear.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the cramped and remote workshops, copies of LA CRONICA are neatly stacked, ready to be distributed throughout the country.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At that hour, the last journalists are leaving the makeshift office and heading home. They leave silently, immersed in the fog. They pass the drunks leaving the bars, the emolientero (beef seller) laboriously pushing his worn wheelbarrow, the policeman on the corner, the first bakers breaking the dawn pedaling their old tricycles.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  NO HAGGLING
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The day's work is over. Under their arms, they carry the copy fresh off the press, like warm bread emerging from a familiar, nearby oven.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In that newspaper, packed into every page, is still latent the tenacious, nervous, tiring, sometimes rough, occasionally exciting, always generous work of a group of men and women, young and old, who, like that day, gave without hesitation the contribution of their work and their intelligence.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For almost a year now, since July 27th of last year to be exact, this contingent of men and women has been tirelessly dedicated to the mission of creating a revolutionary newspaper, free from the vices that characterized sensationalist journalism or that other kind of sellout and surrender.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  STAKE
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At LA CRONICA, the men and women who work in all sections of the newspaper are active in the revolutionary process and contribute daily to furthering the changes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  They don't adopt a wait-and-see attitude, but rather participate decisively in the transformations. They have adopted the "objectivity" that governed journalistic activity during the pre-revolutionary period, to loudly express their absolutely biased attitude toward the Peruvian Revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At LA CRONICA, every day is a day of revolutionary reaffirmation. A workday begins early. Around 8 a.m., the first workers begin to arrive. Some to the precarious premises on Jirón Andahuaylas and others to two rented apartments in a privately owned building that is rising around Plaza Grau.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  FEVERISHLY
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  LA CRONICA doesn't have a suitable facility to house all its sections. Therefore, the staff is scattered, physically separated.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Due to a fraudulent maneuver by the Prados, LA CRONICA lost its own premises, located on Av. Tacna, and had to move to both the Plaza Grau building and the Andahuaylas premises.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At 9 a.m., the entire administrative staff begins working feverishly in the offices located in the rented apartments in Plaza Grau.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At the same time, on Jirón Andahuaylas, the clatter of the teletypes with the lightning news coming from all over the world grows more intense, resounding in the compact, cramped, suffocating space where the Local, Photography, Labor, International, Provincial, Editing sections, the headquarters and the weekly Cronicawan also operate, all in a labyrinth of tables and machines.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  MISSIONS
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The ten journalists who make up the Sports Section are squeezed into a small room reclaimed from a piece of land that used to be a public thoroughfare.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The small space is clean. The tables are tidy. The trash cans are empty. The atmosphere isn't yet strained.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  An old electric clock mounted on a wall in the small newsroom marks the time: 9 a.m.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The newsroom is beginning to liven up. The News Chief and the other section heads arrive. Each one distributes the day's journalistic work. They prepare the Committee Schedule, which lists the tasks each journalist must fulfill in their respective section.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The editors arrive one by one. They chat, read the day's newspapers, and discuss current events aloud, sometimes excitedly. Discussions begin. They take an interest in the work they must do.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At a table also located within the same newsroom, photojournalists prepare their cameras, review their work, and discuss.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Many of those cameras, most of them, are his property. They don't belong to LA CRONICA. They have been provided to the newspaper because those owned by LA CRONICA are scarce. This is also his personal contribution to the Revolution; it expresses his attitude of dedication.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ACTION
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Newsroom is taking on the nervous, bewildered rhythm of every day.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Editors and photojournalists critique the day's edition. With a copy in hand, they exchange ideas and make suggestions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The committees for the various sections are drawn up with the participation of journalists and other workers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It's 10 a.m. and the LA CRONICA staff are in full swing.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the rented apartments of the Plaza Grau building, the administrative staff of the magazines Mundial and Variedades streamline their daily tasks.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But it is in the improvised premises on Jirón Andahuaylas where the rhythm of journalistic work is felt in all its dimensions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The newsroom is the nerve center of the newspaper, the focal point of a great deal of activity that will gradually increase until it reaches its climax at the newspaper's closing time.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At 10 a.m., the hustle and bustle increases. Telephones ring constantly. The atmosphere begins to become tense. There's no air vent in the newsroom, and cigarette smoke pollutes the small room.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The heat increases as work intensifies and the place fills with people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The editors and photojournalists go out to do their work on the street. They always go in pairs. They leave in a hurry. Some leave on their own, using buses, minibuses, minibuses, and even taxis. Others embark on LA CRONICA's own dilapidated vehicles: two old Fiats (a pickup truck and a car), survivors of hundreds of trips across the country.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  EMPTY LAND
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The newsroom enters a period of truce in the daily battle for news.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But in other sections, the work is taking shape, materializing in editorial columns, commentaries, the reception of news reports and their corresponding interpretation according to the newspaper's political line, and the first dispatches from the network of correspondents that cover the entire country.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Editorial Section and the Management Department operate in precarious premises built on an old LA CRONICA site that until just a few months ago was a smelly wasteland. These are temporary premises built with lightweight materials: limestone bricks, pressed wood partitions, and eternite roof panels on wooden slats.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The floors are made of cement, and to cover up their excessive austerity, old carpets and furniture have been placed there, which once belonged to the men of the Prado Empire.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In those simple, half-finished premises, with bare walls and gloomy ceilings, the old-fashioned, time-worn furniture and carpets stand out aggressively.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At noon, the newsroom resumes its feverish pace.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  GREAT WORKSHOP
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The reporters return from the street and begin transferring the impressions they have captured on their journalistic missions onto sheets of paper and photographic paper.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Editors write stories, shape reports, interpret the news, and recount the day's major events in journalistic language.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Photojournalists hurriedly deliver their photographic material, which goes directly to the Lab for processing. The lab is a cramped space erected in a makeshift loft. There, in an opulent atmosphere, the films are developed and returned to the Photography Section's desk as "contacts," small photos that the Photo Editor uses to select the best photographs to appear in the following day's newspaper, accompanying the articles.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Newsroom becomes a vast workshop where many activities are carried out simultaneously: editors type on the few machines in the room; photojournalists discuss which are the best photos; they go up and down to the Laboratory; the Provincial Section editors receive phone calls from various parts of the country; and the Cables Section staff extract cable dispatches from the four teletype machines that operate incessantly, receiving the major news stories that move the world.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It's 3 p.m. and the newsroom is in full swing. The layout artists, who distribute written and graphic material on the newspaper's pages, arrive; the mastheads, those who create the headlines for the stories; and the editors.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The activity is heightened. There's intense work. A true frenzy. Conversations flow in this atmosphere, disturbed by cigarette smoke, the lack of ventilation, and the constant coming and going of nervous, sometimes aggressive men and women, suffocated by the work and the prevailing tension.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  THE CHRONICLE is taking shape. The front page hints: Big news moves journalists. It shakes them. It provokes comment and analysis. Speculation arises about its implications. The impact it will have on the public. Its impact on the life of a people in revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The typewriters are constantly working. There are few of them at LA CRONICA, and many editors have to work long shifts to use one.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But the spirit doesn't wane. The enthusiasm remains strong. Creating revolutionary journalism is the motto, and it's fulfilled every day. At LA CRONICA, there are no schedules. The staff put in long hours of voluntary work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At dusk, the Management, the Editorial Office, the Editorial Department, and the other sections of the Journalism Division maintain a steady pace of work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The pages are created with the abundant material provided by the editors and photojournalists. They are laid out, titled, and then sent to the Viru Company workshops for processing.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The newspaper comes alive as the hours pass. The best stories are chosen, selected for the front page.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  MOTION
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The atmosphere in the newsroom is definitely strained. Tension has risen, and shouts and laughter can be heard. Cheerfulness erupts somewhere in the room, while in a corner a delegation of workers from some sector voices their grievances.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The news ticks as they broadcast the big news from abroad.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "Where's the photo from the Andahuaylas rally?" someone asks loudly from the editing desk. The question echoes throughout the small space and causes a stir in Photography.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It's 8 p.m. and cups of coffee are circulating around the newsroom. The coffee maker isn't stopping. Neither are the typewriters.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Little by little, work is dwindling in that setting. The trash cans are full. The tables are in disarray. The floor is covered in cigarette butts and matchsticks.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The editors who have finished their work leave the newspaper. Others stay on, polishing their articles, identifying photographs, etc.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Those working the night shifts are beginning to take stock of the day's events and are getting ready to work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There is no cafeteria or restaurant at LA CRONICA. The newspaper's employees must eat at nearby restaurants or purchase meals from the services provided by groups of men and women who deliver meals to the workplace.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But neither the deficiencies of the premises, nor the lack of their own workshops, nor the scarcity of work materials, even weaken the enthusiasm of LA CRONICA's workers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Every day and every night, a human contingent molded in the Revolution, participates decisively in producing that newspaper that the Government rightly calls the DIARY of the REVOLUTION.
