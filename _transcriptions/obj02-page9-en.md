  _ONE VOICE WAS HEARD_
  
  that is dawning in our time, Why people gather in the towns. Why the streets and squares overflow with joyful hearts. That is what we will speak of on this page, which has the power of our thoughts. We live in years that will never be forgotten. The suffering of our elders dawns on our flag, just as the seed is buried so that it may bear fruit; our grandparents sowed their hearts to erase the suffering of mankind. A wind of song envelops the world; towns rise like peaks of pristine snow; men who work with a single force shout until they are heard by the stars; they shout their thoughts, they grasp their truths. They grasp their truths as if they were weapons, because these years are years of thought, they are years of decision.
  
  In the voice of the PERUVIAN REVOLUTION, what the youth dreamed of in their ruined years, what Tupac Amaru watered with his blood, the torment of Micacla Bastidas, is becoming a reality. All the anonymous dead, those who suffered a dark death, those who closed their eyes to the mists of the afterlife, all of them return in this dawn that springs from the roots. We must remember these events, climbing the slope of the years every June 7th, and in the name of the One who made the land, in the name of our flag, in the name of all the peoples of Peru, with one voice we must affirm YES. UNTIL MY DEATH, WITH MY LIFE, I WILL DEFEND YOU, MY FLAG. Why must we speak this language? Because this Revolution has returned our lands to us, placed them in our hands. Through this Revolution, the children, the women, the elderly are finding a better life. For them, the soldiers and the men of the people are working with one heart. This Revolution is doing what no one else knew how to do. To the left of the men of the people leads us to more auspicious days. All the soldiers have laid down their pristine lives like cobwebs so that the people may rise up. Let us put our shoulders to the wheel even more so that the Peruvian Revolution may advance farther from the distance, with its sowing hand, with its voice that speaks the beauties of the soul. Likewise, may the years to come find our President Juan Velasco Alvarado, our older brother. May he find him with his condor-like gaze, with his clear and lucid thoughts, with his true speech, with happiness, so that we may advance even further from the paths of the earth.

  _PEASANT LIBERATION_
  
  The Peruvian Revolution is for all the people who work the land. For them, the Revolution is like a new dream.
  
  From the countryside. The reconquest of the land began in October, one of the first steps of the men of the Revolution. The Agrarian Reform is the true language of joy; it not only sows peace and song, it helps people live with joy and optimism. The land has returned to the hands of those who always worked it. The Spanish didn't bring the land in their horses' hooves; they didn't own land. The only land they knew was the land beneath their nails. Now even the wastelands stretch out green, as they should always have been. Technology has arrived in the fields, the grass sprouts. Four-legged animals can multiply endlessly. Only recently are the man of the land taken into account. Before, he lived with his head bowed; since yesterday, he raises his head, stretching it to the heights like a rising star. The local bosses who lived by stealing cows no longer exist; the pongo no longer exists. The fierce patronesses are no longer there, ordering pride; they have silenced those mouths in idle gatherings. In place of those chatter, thoughtful reasonings rise. Bards, songwriters. Let your sweet words reach out so that they may multiply in the mouths of the young. Now the men of the countryside have a place at the great festivals of the people. The authorities receive them, the rulers receive them, and they listen to what the men of the countryside have to say with their own voices. The voice of the man who works in the fields is becoming heard. He is no longer hunchbacked, no longer frightened. Now he only listens to the voice of his gods and works throughout Peru because it is his home. They gather together, helping each other in their work, cultivating their intelligence and their strength, happily. Now the men of the countryside irrigate their own lands with their sweat. Now they no longer open the wounds of men who irrigated the lands of other owners; rather, there are those who help in the language of the men of the countryside. The hearts of Peruvians are no longer disoriented by the false words of the ensnarers. We who have reached this age think better than before. The thieving judges and lawyers can no longer do their thing, they can no longer steal the money of the poor. The Indians were slaughtered working the lands of the mestizos. Many worked for few owners. The children of peasants could only graze cows and walk behind animals. Now even the revived language is enriched with knowledge in the voices of the wise. All this is because in Peru the REVOLUTION has buried the times of suffering, as if the earth had quietly turned over. None of this would have been possible if not for the dawn of October 3rd. There, the happiness of man began to walk. Even our language is now the same as Spanish. We speak our own language only after 44 years. Our language has completed the integrity of our people. We will be one voice,One ear, one will. Without hatred, with one purpose: Peru. Every revolution is a return to the thought of Tupac Amaru. Tupac Amaru's sacrifice brought us the present. He is with us in this new society, and he looks at us every October 3rd, illuminating and clarifying the thoughts of our leaders.

  _IF THIS IS YOUR TOWN_THE PEOPLE MUST CURE HER.
  
  This is Revolution. This is Christmas. For Vilma Vega Huanca, a girl from Vila El Salvador, this is simply agony. No matter the colored lights, no matter the carols, no matter the celebrations, no matter the modesty, no matter the sad hospitals for the poor, no matter the science, no matter the penicillin, no matter the Christmas or the Baby Jesus, Vilma Vega Huanca is dying in bed 34 of the San Bartolom√© Hospital. Yes, a Hospital for the Poor. A daughter of the Revolution, born under the sign of full participation, of solidarity, of social justice, she will probably never know Revolution, nor participation, nor solidarity, nor justice, nor anything other than premature death. Vilma Vega Huanca, ladies and gentlemen, is curable. But she still dies. She dies because her parents don't have jobs and therefore lack the money to buy 1,120 soles worth of medicine. In this era of Revolution, when many of us puff out our chests convinced that Peru is finally changing, someone suddenly stumbles upon a little girl, Vilma, whose life is worth less than a thousand soles. Less than an executive lunch. Less than a television installment. Less than a Christmas tree. Less than the dinner that those who are already satisfied will devour this Christmas Eve. The one who stumbled upon little girl Vilma was a revolutionary journalist. He himself admits that, despite his convictions, he is softening. Because from repeating so much that the Revolution is advancing, it has begun to grow that the Revolution is almost finished, that solidarity exists, that we are all brothers and sisters now, that the inhumane society based on the exploitation of man has been liquidated. But it isn't true. Panting, Vilma's agony, lying in a narrow bed in the hospital for the poor, rang in his ears, reminding him that this Peru of solidarity is not yet true. The disease pneumonia. The place where she fell ill in Sector II of Villa El Salvador, in a house riddled with holes where the brutal cold of these last few nights had wounded her malnourished body. So, with a high fever, her parents had to drive her from Villa El Salvador to a care center. She traveled by Iarus, in the arms of her unemployed father. A doctor examined her and ordered her hospitalization. Once again, she traveled in arms across the city. To Barrios Altos. To the hospital for the poor. To the emergency room. Until she waited for many hours. Until she found a place, bed number 34.
  
  And now what? Everything we've been taught at university, everything we've learned, is useless. We are not the apostles of Jesus Christ; our hands are no good for performing miracles. We must administer medicine. And the hospital has no medicine to cure these children. The voice of the doctor who is caring for the dehydrated, sleepy, exhausted, crying children, who are so young and already beginning to die, already beginning to look like old people, is the voice of a man filled with the bitterness of stubborn faith, of despair. There are no medicines in the hospital. Bemardina Huanca, Vilma's mother, wrings her hands. What is the hospital for then? What doctor, then, what government? What country, then, if a girl dies because there are no medicines? (Yes, nothing more than 1,120 soles worth of basic medicine. Pedro Vega, Vilma's father, tries to calm Bernardina. They're from Cerro de Pasco. Theirs is an old story, one that has been repeated countless times in newspapers, books, essays, and political speeches: abuse by the local boss, abuse by the mine, abuse by the lawyer, abuse by the judge, emigration elsewhere, underemployment, unemployment, hunger. Finally, some hope for Villa El Salvador. It will be a self-managed urban community, they will provide jobs, a socially owned enterprise. Because the problem isn't a roof over their heads, but work. Something to occupy the time that is slipping through Pedro Vega's fingers while his children grow up poorly, while they get sick, while now Vilma is dying. But Bernardina won't rest easy. Meanwhile, in the oxygen tent, her daughter struggles on her own, watched somberly by the nurses: while the doctor avoids looking at the dying little girl, while there is no medicine to save that life and instead there are sparkling wines and celebrations and hisky and office parties and gifts and tickets to dance in a tuxedo on New Year's with party favors and a sympathetic orchestra while the new and supportive Peru ignores this brief and very sad story, Bernardina howled her protest, her fury against a world she has only known as adverse, full of hardships and blows. That was how Bernardina's voice, Bernardina's cries, Bernardina's twisted hands revealed her daughter's fate. The journalists of LA CRONICA have always been treated like brothers by the people of Villa El
  
  Salvador. So we pooled the money in our pockets and were able to buy 28 ampoules of albimycin to cure Vilma. If it's still possible. Because this time we journalists found out late, perhaps because it was a small story. (A small story is the agony of a little girl. A big story is, for example, the trial of a rich and healthy man. A small story is the sadness of Bernardina Huanca, a native of Cerro de Pasco. A big story is the Christmas message of an important public official.) The journalists were later chased away because it's forbidden to take photos, ask questions, or inquire into why Vilma is dying. I don't know if it's forbidden to take sides with Bernardina Huanca and Pedro Vega. But I must say that those of us who work at LA CRONICA are with them. Such identification is our revolutionary essence. Perhaps today we are allowed to speak for Bernardina the words she said, but weren't heard. Tomorrow, if the revolution is all the evolution we yearn for, Bernardina won't need anyone. This is her country. She must be her own master.

  _MAN'S VOICE_
  
  Forty thousand children work. Between the ages of six and fourteen. They work. Those nests grow old working and do not cultivate their intelligence. So many children working wound the heart. The heart of all true men must ache for those children. Throughout the world, forty million children work. Those children sow wounds in the blood with their early work. In the dark mines, extracting gold and silver, the eyes of children grow dark. In distant and faraway villages, those children receive the work of their parents, just as they inherited their surnames. They only receive their jobs, they inherit their debts, their lives of misery, they receive tears from their hearts. Those small beings in the mines suffer unspeakably with intense labor. They only live in those mines; they leave only that life of suffering to their descendants. Those children work for other men, for rich men, they work where children do not work. In the expanses of sand, up the hill, on the peaks, in the cold. All over the world, children work for millionaire capitalists. Capitalism forces children who don't know how to fight to work like strongmen. Capitalism has found its fortune in these children. For this reason, thousands upon thousands of children don't cultivate their intelligence, nor do they live like men. For them, there is only sudden death and suffering. These children only know a difficult life. Children are the pillars upon which revolutions are built: we can still say, only children, with their smiles, measure the happiness of men. There are no words that justify the suffering of children. We must give children a beautiful life so they can burst with joy like flowers. We must leave a well-built people for children. The joy of children lies in the hands of men. For this reason, the Revolutionary Government is building a beautiful people for children, and because we have many children, we must lend a hand to be a just and beautiful people.

  _SECRET CHRONICLE_
  
  UNTIL WHEN WILL THIS BE?
  
  If I go for a day, on what roads will I get lost? On what stone will my weariness rest? When the black wind multiplies its wings with which I will cover myself. I wonder what reasons brought me to live like a river, always passing, unable to take root, like a bird of ill omen looking only at death. Just as a minimal sadness is deceived by playing the fool, in the same way I draw new dreams for myself, I think of the flowers, I look at the wings of the swallows, and I get drunk to see if with that I can cheer my heart, but I am a thorn in the desert, people run from me, like a river of fire, I leave ashes along the roads. I don't know how to fight, I walk without bolas, I don't throw out my hatred, I don't know how to be arrogant. It's as if the whole earth were determined to martyrize an anonymous man. What else can it be, then, that there is so much hate in the world. I look at the hatred and contemplate my youngest son. I kneel and beg for forgiveness because I didn't behave like a good father. Accused of something I didn't do, locked up in a full prison. They accused me of setting fire to a house. My youngest daughter stayed in another house. That's what people say, saying: Thief! You lived among sentinels, I fed, I gave your children food. Helping one another among human beings can't be boastful; it's difficult for it to be good to obscure with slander the light decreed by the heart. I am truly sad. My heart weeps blood; it's as if a great lake dawned, made with the guilt of all the hungers in my heart. It's difficult to live, like climbing a hill too high, like walking with a log on our back. It's as if we were ordering the world without having the thought of God. Only death will end this wind of thorns in our faces. An avalanche of wounds clouds my blood. Sadness charges at me like a raging bull. I am the one who dawns under a rain of shadows, the one who goes to night crowned by a sun of suffering. How long will this last? Oh, it's almost like being run over by an iron chariot in a city of stone men."
