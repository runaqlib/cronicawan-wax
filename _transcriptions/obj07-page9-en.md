  _UNESCO, ITS WORK IN PERU_
  
  We already know the purpose of the UN organization. On this occasion, we will talk about UNESCO and its purpose. UNESCO was founded as an institution dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of peoples and thus contributing to the advancement of human knowledge. To achieve this purpose, UNESCO awards scholarships. These scholarships are provided to both professionals and students, and their allocation is based on the needs of each country, according to the requirements necessary for its development. UNESCO, on the other hand, is charged with seeking the conservation of archaeological remains and historical monuments throughout the world. To this end, it promotes programs for the conservation and restoration of historical monuments, since through these remains we can discover the ways of life, customs, and beliefs of past civilizations, which no longer belong to a single country or people, but are the heritage of humanity. Thus, in Peru, UNESCO has promoted research programs for the restoration and conservation of a series of archaeological remains of enormous historical value, which are a legacy of the civilizations that settled in our country. To this end, a series of conversations were held between the Peruvian government and UNESCO, and a major plan of activities has been agreed upon.
  
  respective agreement, we know by the name of COPESCO Plan.
  
  COPESCO PLAN is an agreement signed between the Peruvian government and UNESCO, which seeks the comprehensive development of the Cusco-Puno region through tourism. In this area of ​​Cusco and Puno, there are a series of archaeological remains, primarily Inca, which, after undergoing a restoration and conservation plan, will be converted into centers of undoubted tourist attraction. Simultaneously with these activities, a series of infrastructure projects will be carried out, including roads and hotels, and the electric power service will be improved. This will lead to a more intense tourism flow to our country. To carry out this entire plan, several Socially Owned Enterprises will be created, which will contribute their production to the various activities to be carried out, including civil construction, handicrafts, and others. There is also a project to convert Machu Picchu into a National Park. Machu Picchu is home to a marvelous Inca structure, and its beautiful landscape makes this area an ideal location for this purpose. To implement the entire program, that is, to fulfill the COPESCO Plan, a total of three billion soles will be invested in the area over five years. With this investment, and the creation of jobs, the aim is to raise the standard of living in the area and prevent the migration of its inhabitants. The establishment of Socially Owned Enterprises will greatly contribute to this goal.
