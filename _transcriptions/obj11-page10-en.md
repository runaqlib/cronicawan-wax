  _BAYOVAR: PROMISING FUTURE_
  
  WHAT IS THE BAYOVAR COMPLEX
  
  It is a set of oil, mining, and industrial projects that will have a multiplier effect and whose magnitude will benefit all of Peru. According to technicians, Bayóvar is the largest and most ambitious project in Peru. Its multiplier effect and wealth generation will reach all regions of the country, but the northern region will especially benefit. The North Peruvian Oil Pipeline terminal, the refinery, and the petrochemical complex will be located in Bayóvar. The phosphate factory will also be located there (phosphates are chemical substances that serve as raw material for the manufacture of fertilizers). The brine plant will also be located in Bayóvar (among other things, brine is a chemical compound that serves as raw material for the fertilizer plant and the caustic soda plant). The Bayovar complex will be located in the department of Piura.
  
  WHY WAS THE BAYOVAR AREA CHOSEN?
  
  Due to the exceptional conditions (seabed, tides, and winds) of Sechura Bay, it is possible to receive deep-draft vessels. Because of this depth, Sechura Bay was chosen as the natural arrival point for the North Peruvian Oil Pipeline. Due to the existence of a wide terrace supported by a vast plain, which facilitates the establishment of industrial and urban activities. Due to the existence of phosphate deposits: proven reserves of more than 500 million tons of rock with more than 30 percent phosphorus oxide (raw material for making fertilizers). Due to the existence of vast expanses of brine deposits. Due to the abundance of hydrobiological resources. Due to its proximity to Talara, which creates a development axis between Piura and Chiclayo.
  
  WHICH IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN BAYOVAR
  
  The North Peruvian Oil Pipeline Terminal is under construction, a 100-km stretch located within the Bayóvar area. It includes the Tank Farm for the storage system of more than three million cubic meters, the control station, and the ballast ponds. The investment for this oil pipeline is 1,397,070,000.00, which will be used to supply the tankers anchored at the oil dock, which is also under construction.
  
  The Bayóvar oil dock will allow for loading one hundred thousand barrels per hour. The oil refinery, which will produce 150,000 BPD of refined products in its first stage, will begin operating in early 1979. It will be twice the size of the Talara refinery and four times the size of the La Pampilla refinery. PHOSPHATES The Phosphate Plant Project, which will require an investment of approximately 1.9 billion soles, will produce 800,000 metric tons of phosphate rock concentrate annually in its first stage, beginning in 1977. Two years later, it will produce 460,000 tons of phosphoric acid annually and 337,000 tons of triple super phosphate and 231,000 tons of diammonium phosphate. Investments will reach approximately 2.5 billion soles for both plants. BRINES With an investment of 23 million dollars, the Brine Plant will produce, starting in 1979, one hundred thousand tons of potassium chloride and one million tons of sodium chloride annually. METALLURGY The metallurgical complex will also produce 200,000 tons of refined zinc annually, 200,000 tons of refined copper, and 700,000 tons of sulfuric acid. This project is subordinate to the start-up of the Michiquillay mines. PROSPERITY AND WORK. This entire complex we are discussing is a challenge for technicians and for the Peruvian University. Peruvian scientists find in Bayóvar a thermometer for their scientific concerns. The economic capacity of the Peruvian State and the creative power of Peruvian technicians will come together in Bayóvar in the common purpose of making a project that has already begun to take shape a reality. Biologists, chemists, geophysicists, civil engineers, mining engineers, mechanics, electrical engineers, and a whole host of other diverse professions have a place in Bayóvar, a place at the service of the nation and technology. Bayóvar will generate a demand for first-class labor like never before seen in Peru. Peruvian technology must respond to the challenge Bayóvar poses.
  
  PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS Among the numerous petrochemical products, Bayóvar will undoubtedly generate a true industrial chain with the production of plastics and fibers. Both fibers and plastics, in turn, will allow for the expansion of textile factories, polyethylene bag factories, and tableware manufacturing. All of these establishments will increase the demand for labor, directly benefiting the vast majority of people.
  
  FERTILIZERS
  
  Bayóvar will produce cheap fertilizers in large quantities. The use of these fertilizers will increase the land's productivity, directly benefiting the Peruvian people. In a country like ours, with its vast geographical features, marked erosion rates, and sloping dryland, only properly fertilized areas produce what is needed. Hence the importance of Bayóvar for the progress of agriculture, its unquestionable necessity, and its direct impact on the country's agricultural production. Bayóvar is truly the hope of Peru. Its implementation and full operation will help Peru definitively emerge from underdevelopment and will be an injection of vitality, work, and effort for all Peruvians.
