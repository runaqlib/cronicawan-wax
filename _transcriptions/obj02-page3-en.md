  _THIS IS WHAT THE FARMERS ASK FOR_
  
  Peasant unions and jungle communities will be integrated into the National Agrarian Confederation (CNA), as agreed upon at the organization's National Assembly, held in Cusco at the end of April, attended by delegates from the various Agrarian Leagues. This agreement was forwarded to the Revolutionary Government requesting that Law 19400 be amended accordingly. Regarding the transfer of the capital's newspaper El Comercio to peasant organizations, a preliminary draft is being drafted. With the approval of this amendment, the Peasant Unions of the Lares Valley and the Convention would be recognized. These organizations existed prior to the enactment of this law, and with it, the jungle communities would be recognized. With these organizations, the CNA will be strengthened, promoting the unity of the peasant sector, a bastion of the Peruvian Revolution. In this major document, the peasant organizations of the Apurimac department requested the support of the CN A for the formation of the Agrarian Federation. To date, there are four Agrarian Leagues corresponding to the provinces of Andahuaylas, Abancay, Aymaraes, and Antabamba, with only the formation of the Agrarian League of the Grau Province still pending. The Apurimac department has approximately 280,000 peasants.

  THIS IS HOW THEY WRITE TO US, THE WORKERS OF CRONICAWAN
  
  Cusco, June 4, 1975 Mr. Angel Avendaño Lima
  
  Dear fellow countryman. Like the rays of the sun, the thoughts of the people of Cusco once again illuminate the paths of the nation in this new era. A profound Cusco virtue is cemented in you, which is why you have begun to write in Quechua, thinking of the destiny of the people of Peru and the best paths they must follow. That's why the "Peruvian Academy of the Quechua Language" joyfully reaches out to you, speaking to you with its true voice. We greatly value your writing with the correct spellings of Quechua; it must be so, as a man born in Cusco, you must persist in the correct language of our mother, Cusco. We want you to continue giving beauty to our sweetest language in that informative CRONICAWAN, speaking of all of Peru, integral and united, so that in this way we may shed greater light on all the peasants of our homeland. Your writings will spread throughout the world; they will travel around the globe. The Quechua you are writing is very good; anyone can read it quickly and understand its content; others confuse our language, borrowing words from other languages. We Peruvians must not make mistakes with our joyful hearts. We always want to receive what you write in this institution of knowledge. See you soon, dear brother. Faustino Espinoza Navarro, Secretary of Organization, Humberto Concha Florez, President, Delia Blanco de Valencia, Former President, Armando Cáceres Aragon Vice President.

  _GENERAL HOYOS_
  
  The progress of the Revolutionary Process was assessed during the town meetings with the ministers. In a recent meeting with the peasant sector, Food Minister General Rafael Hoyos requested more frequent meetings of this kind, also urging them to improve production to avoid shortages and achieve general well-being. He announced that he will travel outside of Lima on weekends to meet with peasant organizations. At the end of May, he traveled to the city of Juliaca to attend the closing of the 1st Agricultural Livestock Fair, held there. He took advantage of his stay to inquire about quinoa and rapeseed cultivation. Rapeseed is similar to turnips; edible oil is extracted from rapeseed. Its cultivation has been studied for its implementation in our country's agriculture. Canada, Japan, and Chile are very good rapeseed producers. In Juliaca, rapeseed has been cultivated on an area of ​​850 hectares; to date, we purchase this product from other countries at very high prices. Regarding wheat, it is being imported from China, where its cultivation in our country is yielding very good results. Farmers who dedicate themselves to this rice crop will be encouraged.

  _MINISTER VISITS US_
  
  From the distant country of Cores, the Minister of Administration visited us, leading a delegation from that country, seeking to connect with the Peruvian Process. They, too, are undergoing a process of building the well-being of their people. Minister Son Song Fil stated that the processes in Peru and Korea are a product of the historical needs of each people, without the imposition of other nations. He emphasized that, like us, they safeguard their natural resources, which they then return to the people. He also said that the people and government of Peru and Cores should help each other to achieve better understanding. This will reinforce the consolidation of the Third World, in which they will also participate. He agreed to return to our country soon to meet with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel de la Flor Valle, with whom he will reach agreements for the next conference of Third World countries.

  It's been four years since the government enacted the Law of a beginning, beginning, and then the Law of Community and Mining Compensation. These two laws contribute to the well-being of mining workers, along with that of the entire population, so that our natural resources, such as copper, gold, silver, etc., that are mined, will revert to the well-being of our nation. Likewise, mining workers must be aware of the provisions of the aforementioned laws, managing their respective companies with strength and determination. With everything exploited in the mines and reverting to our people, we will achieve national well-being. From "Cronicaan," we rejoice and unite on this, your mining anniversary.
