  **WHAT THEY WORK ON**
  
  
  
  Eighty percent of the children who work do so as shoeshiners. Their box, polishing tools, and clothing distinguish them from the other working children. We spoke with Manuel and Julio T., brothers who live in Villa el Salvador. Manuel is in fourth grade (basic school in the Education Reform). He says he's been shining since January of this year to earn money to buy his uniform. He doesn't want to say anything else, just smiles. Julio, the younger brother, is more talkative. He states: "His father died a long time ago and he doesn't send any money, so he has to work." He says his mother has a bad arm and can't work. "My mother has an immobile arm and can't work, we come from Villa El Salvador at six in the morning, we leave at five in the afternoon. Mrs. Emilia Deron gives us lunch for fifteen soles, she serves us cau cau soup every day. We earn fifty to eighty soles, sometimes more because they pay us five soles a day. We come from "mancha" from El Salvador, we don't have problems with the police. I haven't thought about growing up yet, maybe I'll just hambear (work). I'm happy to help my mother, my brother Manuel and I make more than one hundred soles. I like to play more than work, when my father sends me to Villa El Salvador, we don't go to "chambear"... Like Manuel Julio, hundreds of children daily visit the parks and plazas with their box of brushes and creams. They work for their uniforms, for their parents for their house, never for candy, they are the wage earners of the misfortune, the most unfortunate of workers has some of their pay, yes, working children have to be precise with their accounts. ..one Sunday, my father came home dizzy and started yelling at my mother then went out into the street then, my mother said he had to go to work because my father drank a lot the money wasn't enough, My brother and I went to buy groceries. The next day I saved it in the cash register. I took out just went to work. My brother for my fare. The bus took me to Caquetá and it was full and I couldn't move forward in one place and went to another I grabbed a seat, the market. The first day the police told me to rang the bell to get off I should go, because in Caquetá but the bus didn't stop, I got off
  
  
  
  Llank'ayninwan yanaparikun, allin runa kananpaq Your work helps you be a good man.
  
  
  
  Taytankuta yanaparikuspa was prohibited from selling. I grabbed my package and became more amoeba, next to a fish stand and people started buying from me. It was eleven in the morning and I had sold one hundred soles, the sun was burning hard and my head started to hurt. Since there were no more people, I lifted my cash register and stopped to go to work so they wouldn't steal my money, the bus was going at full speed. Helping his parents, I found a bus stop far from my house. From there I returned, gave my mom the money, washed my hands and waited for the next meal. My dad picked me up early and told me we had to go to work. It was very cold. We went to work at the Ciudad y Campo market. My dad showed me the markets and the following week I went to sell alone... nobody fooled me, not even the city council members told me this street is not good for selling. I know all the markets and I always sell alone.
