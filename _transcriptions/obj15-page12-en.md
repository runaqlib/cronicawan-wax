  and our strange nostalgia for the past, our disconnection of feelings from reality in this city that is a refuge of necromancy, where a faint murmur communicates the just with the unjust. But my city thrives under the outstretched wing of the vultures, and everything is related to everything: the blind with the darkness and the fool with certainty, and this city will surely answer for its apocalyptic beasts: from 1808 to 1824 Wars of the Bourgeoisie. 1825 distribution of the land with its men and its animals, in between—a black city refuge from the very darkness—there is no memorable year in which to admire the streets, to seek a reflection of the times. And only the enervating smell of the breweries, the putrid aromas of incense climbing toward the high windows, and an old demiurge grazing a flock of lice in the Hotel Comercio: Martin Adan. But the city prefers submissive pain to rebellion; rather than a living man, we will take a dead man. We will weigh in gold the exact mathematical figure of his. Then surely this is the year of the Lord. But the sounds of this time are a murmur of traffic and nothing exalted, nothing moved by previous experience, the dull bustle of the granite bird of the merchants, the dealers, and lecturers. They guard our peace: the weak have once again discovered the city of vomitoriums; the weak and the strong have once again respected their lairs and palaces, and the city is bored. And for whom is the moon born like a mirror in which PRCONQCRSA? For whom are there beautiful bare legs on the calendars month after month? For whom are fictitious scenes of happiness painted among the slums? Ah, creeping eyes! The days are counted on the merchants' wild abacus, and for money many a youthful face has turned red with shame! And old men have ceased to be wise through business mistakes or bad investments; they give YEN. And will a distant drum continue beating in the night among the wastelands? And will a distant clamor of murmurs still be heard, stopped by a slap? But will tiny noises still be heard in the distance? Beware of stubborn rebels: That is where the true predictions are.

  Little miner’s bird with red tin sheets (dear brother Pedro), Black worker-bird, plumber-bird, zinc-bird. These cut feathers will embrace you again, pencil-bird, sonnet-bird, movie-poet-bird. Mantaro River, let me cross (no one calls me from the faraway shore):) from the year 54 they send me to call the sea, aa to travel, the whole night I can’t arrive The pale stench of human bodies inevitably reminds him of the dry smell of fire, even today—20 years later—does the morning grooming crack his knuckles in a stream of crystalline stone, does the sight burn him (like nocturnal carbide in some mines of Huancavelica).
