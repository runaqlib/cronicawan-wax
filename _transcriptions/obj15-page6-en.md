  THOUSANDS OF PERUVIAN CHILDREN AGE PREMATURELY, DEVOTED TO ROUGH WORK. THEY DO NOT KNOW THE JOY OF CHILDHOOD, THEY DO NOT KNOW OF THE MAGIC OF TOYS, NOR OF THE JOY OF PLAY. NOT ALL CHILDREN WORK, THEY DO SO DRIVEN BY THEIR CHILDREN, THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE FOUGHT BY THEIR CHILDREN OR BY CRUPULAR PEOPLE. THE MOST UNLIKELY OCCUPATIONS AND THE MOST INCREDIBLE ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT BY CHILDREN.
  
  
  
  Children who work no longer accuse, they are accumulating hatreds, complexities, frustrations breathing winds of indolence. Apart from the fear and affection of their elders, they do not know the joy of childhood and they have to multiply their forces to procure their daily sustenance. What does it matter if a child works! Against whom does it attack! To whom does it diminish! kunapichu samarinku. Qhapaq given existence, the world is Every day it takes more compassion! protection of minors smaller and more alien, personal interest is above any other motivation. People do not notice situations or circumstances they walk stimulated by the shadow of fortune or bitten by poverty, but who immersed in their personal life. The sting of poverty leaves no stone unturned to overcome this situation, even if one of those means is to make the entire family work, under the absurd logic that children must earn their daily bread. There are those who live off the labor of children, finance their small businesses, exploit them relentlessly and hastily. Seven-year-old David L. confessed to us that he had to bring fifty pounds a day home; if he didn't, his mother would abuse him. "If I don't comply, my father will kill me," he expressed in a lacerating revelation. Half of them said it with words, the other half with their eyes. How many children like David are victims of their own? But the problem of child labor does not lie in isolated events or occasional dilemmas. Its roots lie in the unfair distribution of wealth, in economic and social inequality. The historical need to overcome this state of affairs also entails freeing children from all types of wage-earning jobs. Only a fair and consistent society will treat children with deference and respect as befits their human condition. As long as our society does not become humanistic and supportive, the protection of children will be a wish that is lost in the codes, a vague cry for help far from the reality of the laws that protect minors. Every day there is more ruthlessness!

  **WHERE THEY COME FROM**

In a tabulation Ilaqma epiñan Rumca or, Hill of relatively little tea of ​​Peru. Twenty percent come from homes in Lima that young people recently come from broken homes or are children of ill repute. Of all of them, the cases of children whose parents are alcoholics are particularly wicked. They are sometimes the negative cultural patrons of which they are victims: You cannot expect to achieve anything from children who congregate in the markets (especially in the Parada) to survive in any way. The sordid environment, the indifferent crowd, the rabble and the lumpen that circulate there are a anti-school of fratricidal material abandonment and human unity
