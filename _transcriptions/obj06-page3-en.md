  _THE DEMAND HAS BEEN MET_SOYBEAN OIL FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.
  
  With the importation of 41,900 metric tons of soybean oil from the International Market, the National Inputs Marketing Company (ENCI) has covered the country's demand until next October. "Carta Semanal," the Ministry of Commerce's newsletter, states that the oil supply has thus been guaranteed. The same source indicates that 9,100 metric tons remain to be imported to meet consumption demands for the last two months of the year. This amount will cover the annual volume of soybean oil, the total import of which has already been authorized by the government. This year's volume to meet domestic demand reaches 51,000 metric tons.

  The Board of Directors of the Development Finance Corporation (COFIDE) agreed to grant a loan to EMADIPERU for up to 31 million soles for the "Arequpara Industrial Park - Stage 3" project.

The project essentially consists of expanding the park by 134,500 square meters: complementary works for the first and second stages and the construction of a 1,400 cubic meter reservoir for the four stages that will comprise the park. With the third stage, the park's total area will increase to 649,000 square meters. The facilities of the third stage will accommodate, among others, the glass, leather, plastics, alcohol, spring, nail, electrical capacitor, and rectifier industries, as well as the local expansion of the SENATI facilities. There are also plans for the location of the Peruvian Electronic Complex.

  _PUNO REQUESTS A BRANCH OF THE INC_
  
  PUNO, July (CRONICAWAN).- A lengthy and well-founded memorandum has been sent to the Director of the National Institute of Culture, signed by the guardianship entities of Puno, requesting that a branch of the National Institute of Culture be established in this city. The petition sets forth a series of reasons, highlighting the rich cultural heritage of the department of Puno, which is currently manifested in more than one hundred institutions dedicated to cultural activities: painting, music, sculpture, crafts, folklore, archaeology, etc. Most of these are made up of the same people who create and preserve this culture, and which year after year grows in its different manifestations. The need for a branch of the National Institute of Culture to operate in Puno has been a long-standing request. On this occasion, various social, cultural, and sports entities have mobilized to demand this right. The document sent to Dr. Martha Hildebrandt also indicates that the bilingualism recently formalized by our Revolutionary Government will greatly promote the cultural and artistic activities of our people, which fully justifies the creation and immediate operation of the Puno Branch of the National Institute of Culture.

  _GUINEA PIG MEAT CONTAINS 20.3% OF_PROTEINS
  
  Guinea pig meat has been established as a high-protein food, and its consumption is increasing annually in Peru. According to an analysis conducted by the Department of Nutrition at the National Agrarian University and the National Center for Agricultural Research in La Molina, it has 20.3% protein. It is followed by beef with 17.5% protein, poultry with 18.3% protein, sheep with 16.4% protein, and pork with 14.5% protein. These figures are lower in nutritional value than those of rodents. Its advantages are not limited to this. Its rapid production and economical breeding, in addition to its pleasant flavor, make it one of the ideal foods. Although few people in Lima are dedicated to marketing it, in the interior of our country it is widely accepted and sold. In 1973, the guinea pig population was 20 million animals, a low figure due to the poor technology used in family farming. The Ministry of Food is responsible for disseminating and promoting an organizational and technological strategy to achieve higher production levels than the current ones.
