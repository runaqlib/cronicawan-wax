  **WHAT HE SPOKE TO MIRANTE ROSA COUTINHO.**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This is what Admiral Rosa Coutinho spoke about, he is the Chief of the Portuguese Navy, he is also a member of the Armed Forces Movement. On the occasion of the Non-Aligned meeting, Admiral Rosa Couthino, presiding over the Portuguese delegation, came to our country from Peru. "When it is said that we are a dictatorship, it is a contradiction. There is no dictatorship that seeks to hand over power to the bases. We consider that the extreme left is with us on the same side of the barricade. That a basically healthy ideology prevails among them and an impatience of youth that is also natural. Simply put, it is necessary to win them back for the revolutionary process. The MFA opened the doors of the revolution and keeps them open. The revolution flows through it and is led by the people. The MFA always treats the allies, the various lefts, as allies, even if they sometimes do stupid things, never as enemies. This is a basic principle, grassroots organizations must be made up of people who know each other. It is clear that the process is difficult. We must fight against people's own impatience. As long as the objective is common, we consider that to be constructive. The revolution must be carried out with sacrifice, but it also has happy stages. A revolution cannot be sad.
