  **SINAMOS WAS BORN FOR THE PEOPLE**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Under the name SiNAMOS, we know the National System to Support Social Mobilization. On April 4, 1972, with Decree Law 18896, the Revolutionary Government created SINAMOS. To integrate SINAMOS they united eight organizations, seeking to create a new Institution, an Institution that responds to the conceptualization of the new society of the Peruvian Revolution. Law 18896 makes known the functions of SINAMOS, there we see what things it must work on: Training the national population, promoting its organization, also providing guidance to popular organizations, so that they can follow the path of the Peruvian Revolution. Likewise, promote the development of Social Interest organizations, such as Cooperatives, SAIS, Peasant Communities and others. To carry out these actions, SINAMOS was born, which is why the so-called grassroots organizations have spread throughout our country, which cannot be subject to political manipulation, and that only the components of these organizations decide on their forms of organization and the objectives of their organization, freely and independently.

  will record the National Information System SINADI. But what is SINADI, what does it do, we will talk about that a little. SINADl rises up to tell all people the truth, what we are doing in our town, and likewise, what it is doing in other towns. That is what it will warn, the truth, without increasing or hiding anything, so that it is known as it is, so that we know the truth, and it will also make foreign countries known to other countries, so that they know everything we do. But when spreading this news, it will do so taking care that it does not interfere with National Security, taking care of people's dignity. To do these things, SINADI has created ESiPERU, which will make known throughout the national territory everything that is done in our country; Likewise, it has created ESI ANDINA, to make known abroad everything we do in our country. SINADI is directed by General Leonidas Rodriguez Figueroa.
