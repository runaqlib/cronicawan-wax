  _HUAYANAY COMMONERS_THEY ASK FOR HELP FROM THE CNA
  
  On the occasion of the Oath of Allegiance to the Flag, community member Lorenzo de la Cruz Taypi came to the city of Lima, along with the delegation from the Huayanay Community, where in a patriotic gesture they renewed their loyalty to our flag and its Revolution. They then returned to their community, where Lorenzo de la Cruz Taypi was arrested again, thus revoking his provisional release due to the "Huayanay Case," as is public knowledge. It is also common knowledge that 14 people accused of the death of Cesar Matias Escobar were held in the Huancavelica prison. Seven peasants were later released on provisional release, while the rest of the defendants remain in public prison to date. The seven peasants with provisional freedom joined the delegation of the Huayanay Community on their trip to this city to renew their loyalty to the Flag and the Peruvian Revolution and having fulfilled their patriotic attitude they returned to their community. The community member Lorenzo de la Cruz was arrested by order of the Investigating Judge and is currently in the Huancavelica jail. This is the reason for the presence in the city of Lima of two community members also on Provisional Freedom who, fearing the same fate, have presented a document before the 110th Investigative Court requesting guarantees from said authority: community members Victor de la Cruz Escobar and Donato de la Cruz Escobar. The following community members, Eulogio, Mariano Concepción, and Marcial de la Cruz Escobar respectively, are also added to them. Those who also ask the National Agrarian Confederation to intervene with its help to accelerate the resolution of the "Huayanay Case." Thus, the weekly Cronicaan asks the Revolutionary Government to intercede for a prompt solution.

This agreement is an additional document to the aforementioned bilateral agreement, which began in July 1973 and was extended in October of last year. "Rio Damuji" is authorized to carry out its fishing activities for a period of five months, beginning on June 9th. It will be fishing in conjunction with the Cuban fleet, which is operating under the aforementioned agreement at an annual cost of one million five hundred thousand dollars.

  _Technology transfer will do_The Agrarian of La Molina to peasants.
  
  In a novel experiment that has been producing satisfactory results, the National Agrarian University of La Molina is implementing an interesting technological transformation plan for rural areas, through groups of professors and students who gradually leave the classrooms to live with agricultural workers. This revelation was made by Engineer Miguel Sarria, Director of the UNA's Animal Husbandry Academic Program, at the end of the press conference held by the university to present to the press the progress of the research program for the production of fish-based sausages. He noted that, in this regard, there is, for example, an agreement between the National Agrarian University of La Molina and the Ministry of Agriculture (UNAMA) for technical assistance. During the last two years, he revealed, four large groups, made up of professors and students, have visited regions in the interior of the country. They went during the summer and mid-year vacations.
  
  These visits and periods of coexistence between students and farmers have provided farmers with modern knowledge and, at the same time, provided invaluable experience for the students, who have experienced the reality on the ground. He said that as a result of the presence of these four groups and others that have intermittently traveled from UNA to the countryside, there are 82 investigations into specific problems posed by agriculture in different parts of the country. The groups participating in this exchange include five to ten professors and students.

  _Modern center is being built_of wool dyeing in Ayacucho.
  
  In order to improve the artisanal textile industry, the Peruvian Handicraft Promotion Company (EPPAPERU) is building a modern wool dyeing center in Ayacucho, with an investment of over one million soles. As is known, in the Ayacucho region, a large part of the rural population is dedicated to the production of wool handicrafts, which have recently been widely accepted not only by tourists but also due to increased demand in both the domestic and international markets. The Ayacucho dyeing center will provide a valuable service to weavers and artisans once it is operational, which is expected before the end of the year. According to an EPPAPERU report, in addition to the aforementioned services, the center will also provide ongoing advice to artisans on improving the quality of their wool work, with improved dyeing using both natural dyes with plant-based products and chemical dyes, using more modern techniques.
