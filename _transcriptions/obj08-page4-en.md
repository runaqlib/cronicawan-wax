  HAVANA, July 1975 (PL). - Cuba and Panama signed an agreement whereby their planes will make five weekly trips carrying passengers from one city to the other and vice versa, that is, Havana-Panama and Panama-Havana. Pursuant to this agreement, scheduled flights carrying passengers will begin on July 25 of this year. Revolutionary governments are in power in both Panama and Cuba. Mr. Fidel Castro governs Cuba, and General Omar Torrijos governs Panama.

  LISBON, July 18.- Supporters of the Revolutionary Government have responded to the march on Lisbon called by the Socialist Party with an order to mobilize their forces to stop what they call a counterrevolutionary offensive.
  
  Just as on the eve of September 28, 1974, the day of the fall of General Spinola and the decisive leftward shift of the Portuguese regime, supporters of the Revolutionary Government called for road barricades to be erected to prevent opposition members from entering Lisbon. The same call was also made in Porto, where the Socialist Party called for a large demonstration against the government tonight. The risk of violent confrontation is looming, as have attacks that have occurred in recent days in several towns north of Lisbon, where offices of the PCP and the Popular Socialist Front were looted. In response to this situation, troops have been placed on alert in certain regions. The COPCON Unit Commanders held a meeting this morning, described as very important, during which arrangements were made to ensure the maintenance of order should the need arise. The COPCON issued a statement stating that it will not hesitate to use arms should the need arise. He accuses political parties of pushing the popular masses into confrontation instead of acting harmoniously to find a solution to the crisis. At the governmental level, Prime Minister Vasco Goncálvez continued his consultations today with a view to forming the New Government. He met in particular with the communists Alvaro Cunhal and Octavio Pato, as well as several military figures. But observers believe the opposition is seeking provocation and anarchy.
  
  **SAN JOSE DE COSTA RICAPI CUBA**LLAQTAMANTA RIMANQAKU**
  
  SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), JULY 16 (From our news services) -- Delegates from 21 American nations began a plenipotentiary conference here today to leave behind the last vestige of the "Cold War," the anachronistic provisions of the TIAR (Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance), under which Cuba was "excluded" from the inter-American system eleven years ago.
  
  All observers believe there is virtually a consensus to approve the protocol reforming the TIAR, a continental defense instrument approved in 1947 in Rio de Janeiro as part of the North American strategy to contain the communist world. The new policy of appeasement and coexistence among the major world powers makes this "updating" of the TIAR necessary so that the American continent can also access the benefits of international détente. Cuba was sanctioned with an economic blockade in 1964 due to its Marxist-Leninist socialist political system, but the damage caused by such measures not only fell on the Castro regime but also unbalanced the continental system. The American nations' break with Cuba, with the notable exception of Mexico, only reinforced their economic and political dependence on the North American metropolis and also signified the advance of forces within their own countries. In San José, it will probably not be openly discussed, given that some countries insist on preserving the legal forms of a Treaty that has been ignored in practice by a good portion of the American nations.
