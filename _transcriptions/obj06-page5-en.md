  **READJUSTMENT OF PRICES AND WAGES**
  
  _CHANIN CHANINCHAKUY_
  
  Prime Minister Francisco Morales Bermúdez has provided a comprehensive explanation to the country of the reasons that led the Revolutionary Government to readjust the prices of items subject to inspection and control, as well as salaries in both the public and private sectors. First, it is worth emphasizing that our economy has been affected by the crisis of the international capitalist system; indeed, imported inflation is a fundamental factor in the genesis of the internal imbalances that the national economy has been experiencing. Since Peru's productive apparatus is not yet capable of supplying a series of essential goods and inputs, we are forced to import them, thus introducing price-altering factors into the country, since these goods and inputs determine their prices within the context of economies experiencing acute inflation. Thus, the country is forced to pay more abroad for food, oil, fertilizers, etc., which are essential goods for the functioning of the national economy. As we can see, Peru's productive apparatus is still dependent on external economies, which is a permanent source of vulnerability. The historical responsibility for this dependence lies with the traditional oligarchy that made our country an exporter of raw materials and an importer of inputs and manufactured goods: this oligarchy, in alliance with imperialism, turned the national economy into an appendage of capitalist economies. This structural dependence can only be corrected in the long term, while its immediate effects can be counteracted to some extent with the economic policy instruments at the disposal of the Revolutionary Government.
  
  This is precisely the purpose of the price and wage adjustment measures. The country had been facing serious price imbalances, resulting in a degree of economic instability and a reduction in workers' real income. It was therefore necessary to provide an organic, comprehensive solution to the problem of prices and wages. During 1974, the consumer price index in Lima increased by 19%, while in the first four months of this year it has been 10%. Furthermore, imbalances could be observed between the relative prices of different goods and services. For example, the controlled prices of essential products discouraged the production of some of these goods; the prices of non-essential goods were freely set, thereby incentivizing producers to invest precisely in those sectors that were not essential to meeting the needs of the population. It is worth noting here that the Revolutionary Government has redefined its subsidy policy by eliminating gasoline subsidies and focusing subsidies on fertilizers. This is expected to encourage agricultural producers to use them and consequently increase food production and productivity in general. The reallocation of subsidies will also be a measure of income redistribution, as production costs in the countryside will be lower. A distortion between the prices of final goods and the prices of the inputs necessary for their production had also been observed. This resulted in increased production costs, limiting the possibilities for investment and reinvestment. Finally, the relationship between domestic prices and international market prices encouraged smuggling to neighboring countries and shortages within our country. The price control policy for essential goods and services limited the excessive rise but had the consequence of discouraging the production of these items: this particularly affected food production, which since 1971 has barely increased by 1% annually, while demand in urban centers increased by 5% annually. National food production was stagnant, which forced increasing imports to meet domestic demand, with the consequent expenditure of foreign currency. It was therefore necessary to readjust prices to overcome supply problems, incentivizing producers to direct their investments toward the production of essential goods and products. On the other hand,It was also necessary to readjust the salaries of public and private sector workers to compensate for the loss of purchasing power resulting from imported inflation and the recently approved price adjustments. In doing so, the Revolutionary Government has given priority to lower-income workers, who are more exposed to the upward effects. Naturally, the recently approved salary and wage increases will be considered insufficient by some sectors; but it is worth remembering that international economic experience has conclusively demonstrated that
  
  A considerable increase in wages that is not accompanied by an equally considerable increase in production has devastating effects on the economy, triggering an uncontrollable inflationary spiral that quickly nullifies the effect of the wage increase. One aspect that should not be overlooked is the effect that the price increase will have on the underemployed, who will not benefit from the wage increases because they lack stable employment and wages. This is a problem that can only be resolved with the development and deepening of the revolutionary process that finally creates the required number of jobs. For now, the economic rebalancing measures introduced by the Revolutionary Government, by resulting in greater public sector investment based on resources previously excessively absorbed by subsidies, will also have an impact on the creation of new jobs, contributing to solving the unemployment problem. All these factors shape the revolutionary meaning of price and wage readjustments.

  Panama's primary natural resource is its strategic geographic position: the Central American isthmus. Simon Bolivar, the visionary genius who anticipated the ebb and flow of continental life, highlighted the importance of Panama's geographic location more than a century and a half ago. Just as the primary wealth of other countries is copper, and of others, tin, oil, coffee, or bananas, Panama's primary wealth is its canal, an artificial waterway that connects the giants of the Atlantic and Pacific. However, this wealth is in foreign hands. The Panamanian people exercise no control over the privileged zone through which a large volume of international trade and transit moves. There, and throughout Panama's history as an independent republic, the sovereignty of a foreign nation reigns. Of other men and other forces. Colonial forces are alive and well, and find their greatest expression in the so-called Canal Zone. Since 1903, the United States has administered a territorial strip that divides Panamanian soil in two. On that strip of Panamanian land, the colonialist flag of the North American Union flies. Panamanian laws do not apply on that Panamanian land; the ties of a lifelong agreement supported by the right of arms and complex historical circumstances allow North American administrators to deprive Panamanians of their national rights and the most valuable part of their territorial identity. The Panama Canal, which has largely contributed to the consolidation of North American hegemony in our hemisphere, brings the United States not only the fabulous
  
  gains derived from the mileage savings that crossing the canal would mean for ships passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the Strait of Magellan, but also—as the Panamanian government has repeatedly denounced—it places Panama in the crosshairs of potential attacks to which the United States could be subjected. Violating key clauses of the old treaty, the United States has established 14 military bases in the Canal Zone, where American soldiers are trained, and when it suits Washington, they deploy there to suppress the liberation aspirations of the American peoples, as in the cases of the Bay of Pigs and the Dominican Republic. All of America agrees with the current revolutionary government of Panama that the Canal must be a zone that contributes to peace among the different sister nations of the continent and not a front for war tension. Surrounded by high barbed wire fences, the Canal Zone lies within the very heart of the Panamanian capital, like a wound that wounds the entire American land. Defying the machine guns of the empire, the most valuable of Panamanian youth, its students, slapped the barbed walls with their blood in 1964. For 11 years, the Panamanian government has been negotiating with the United States for a new treaty that, overcoming the infamous "in perpetuity" clause of the old one, will allow Panamanians to recover, day by day, more and forever, their sovereignty over the most valuable part of their territory. The United States delays the negotiations. The imperial forces, wounded in their metabolism, twist and maneuver to avoid losing control of one of the most strategic positions on the planet. But Panama, along with its leader, Omar Torrijos, says to the conscience of the free peoples, "With my strength, every time, no colony can last a hundred years, nor any Panamanian who can endure it." And the peoples of the Americas stand side by side with their Panamanian brother.
