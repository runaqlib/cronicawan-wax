  _THE THIRST OF THE TREES_
  
  Like all living beings, plants also need water for their development and existence. Thus, this water can be considered a kind of plasma of the plant's blood, in which numerous products are dissolved, carried by the circulation to all parts of the plant. Tree leaves continually evaporate water into the atmosphere. Ingenious calculations and experiments have allowed us to scientifically establish the amount of water evaporated by a hundred-year-old beech tree during a single summer: around 9,000 liters. If we assume that 400 of these trees can fit into a hectare, we would have an evaporation rate of 3,600,000 liters in summer. Suppose this amount is evenly distributed over the surface of the hectare, this gives a depth of 36 cm. If a huge mass of water were to fall as rain on bare earth—without trees or other vegetation—it would sweep away a large amount of this earth, while the rest of the water would infiltrate into the soil. In that case, that water could no longer play its role in the life cycle.
  
  Nature. In a forest, however, this water is drawn to the treetops in summer and returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. It has been determined that a beech forest returns 60% of rainfall to the atmosphere in this way. This is the importance of forests to the health of a region. These reasons are unfortunately considered by many to be exaggerated. Water rises in plants at different rates depending on the species. We indicate three types of trees: a pine, a poplar, and an oak, with the height at which the sap rises in one hour. We see that in a pine, the water does not rise 1 m in one hour. The water evaporated by trees—and other plants—comes mainly from the ground. We are thus faced with a new marvel: the fact that the leaves at the top of a tree can draw in water—sometimes at a height of 30 m—from the ground. They must have a powerful pump to carry out this operation. Groundwater contains numerous substances useful to the tree, and it is drawn in by the fine vessels that begin at the root tips. Sometimes there are fungi that assist the roots in this task. Absorption takes place through the thin skin of the roots and is distributed throughout the trunk, branches, and leaves by a network of vessels. Upon reaching the leaves, the water passes through the veins and from there penetrates the entire surface of the tree by osmosis. We have seen that plants have cells that contain chlorophyll and, by harnessing solar energy, are extraordinary producers of sugar. Each cell becomes a small pump that draws in water. The number of cells is incalculable and, together, forms the great suction power of the tree, which can thus bring groundwater to its summit. Then the water evaporates through the pores of the leaves. However, as plant physiology progressed, it was determined that this pressure is not sufficient to transport the sap to such a great height. The attractive force of the leaves is therefore indispensable.
