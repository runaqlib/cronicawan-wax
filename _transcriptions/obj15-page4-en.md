  **OSCAR VADILLO, MUSICIAN**
  
  
  
  "Don't continue with music, continue with your architecture," a professor at the National Conservatory of Music told Oscar Vadillo. Knowing that he was confident in what he was doing, he persisted, and time proved him right. Oscar Vadillo, 35, from Huancayo, now works as director of one of the most famous orchestral groups in the world: the Bavarian State Opera, Munich National Theater, whose principal conductor is Maestro Wolfgang Sawalich.
  
  
  
  —What is your specific role? —My position is that of choirmaster, specifically. This is the person in charge of musically preparing the works that are going to be staged. It means working with singers, choirs, orchestras, ballet, and everything related to opera or ballet. From his first musical studies at the Conservatory back in 1959, he has spent 16 years of intense academic and professional life. Oscar Vadillo has an impressive resume. He has been director of the Lima Philharmonic Choir, director of the Huánuco Regional Music School, and director of the Music Department of the Chamber Orchestra of the Junín House of Culture (Huancayo). In 1969, he received a scholarship.
  
  
  
  from the German Academic Exchange Service to pursue studies in the Federal Republic of Germany. He entered the Munich School of Music, where he majored in Orchestral Conducting and minored in Choral Conducting, Chamber Music, and Lieder Accompaniment. Later, in 1973, he enrolled in Musicology at the University of Munich. "I intended to pursue a doctorate, but I decided against it." -- Why? -- It's simple: a doctorate meant a deeper understanding of musical theory, but at the same time a step away from practice... And I've always wanted to be an activist in musical practice... Vadillo graduated last year as an Orchestra Conductor from the Munich School of Music. Now his work at the Bavarian State Opera serves as his postgraduate practice. During his stay in Lima—for family reasons—the musician had planned to compile folklore material for a dissertation in Germany, but this was thwarted when the portable recorder he was bringing for that purpose was confiscated at Airport Customs. We asked him his opinion of the National Symphony Orchestra. He told us it was difficult to compare it with European orchestras, also that he "had seen it as lacking in the number of instrumentalists." He emphasized the need for Lima to have a larger concert hall. "The Municipal Theater does not meet the necessary acoustic conditions," he explained. Regarding the number of concertgoers, he said it has increased; however, he added that it is shocking to see some people smoking or entering and leaving the hall during the concerts. This should be avoided, he stated.
