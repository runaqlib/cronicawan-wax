  **WARM WAR FOR EMPTY STOMACHES**
  
  
  
  UNITED NATIONS NY (To Cronicawan). The policy of international appeasement "put an end to the Cold War, but the lukewarm war of empty stomachs in the underdeveloped world continues," said Dominican Ambassador Alfonso Moreno Martinez today at the United Nations. Likewise, during his intervention in the general debate of the extraordinary Assembly of the UN, he affirmed that "the new international economic order must be only the
  
  
  
  first step to achieve the new international human order". This development must be supported by the efficient use of natural resources and the reorganization of the economy, through the implementation and expansion of agrarian reform and other necessary measures to achieve a fair redistribution of income and opportunities. Referring to the problem of raw materials, he stated that "we underdeveloped countries do not like to imagine our lands as a lunar landscape full of craters, left by the extractive machinery of those who did not have our natural resources, but did have the technical knowledge and capital to exploit them.

  **THE POWER OF FORCE**
  
  
  
  WASHINGTON, September 10 (EFE)— The use of force continues to be a primary instrument of U.S. foreign policy, with the explicit support of a majority of the citizenry. But that same majority believes the United States should not compromise "new lives" in exchange for the loyalty of corrupt governments, as was the case in South Vietnam. "Fifty percent of the American public continues to believe that 'the United States can stop those aggressors who seek to take over our weakest allies.'" Then, "sometimes we have to support a government we don't like because a communist victory would be worse." This was the opening of a series of hearings in Congress today, Wednesday, aimed at outlining the ideal development of the future foreign policy of the United States.

  **NICARAGUA: FRONT AGAINST POVERTY**
  
  
  
  UNITED NATIONS September 10.— (CRONICAWAN ).— Speaking before the 5th Special Assembly of the United Nations, the Nicaraguan Ambassador, Guillermo Sevilla Sacasa, today called on participants to "Build a Front against Poverty." It is necessary, he added, Sevilla Sacasa added, to sweep away all obstacles that impede the economic development of Third World countries. The Nicaraguan Ambassador then said that the establishment of a New International Economic Order should also aim to facilitate real participation of nations in decision-making centers. Reiterating his delegation's support for the Program of the Group of 77 Non-Aligned Countries, the Nicaraguan representative said, however, that it would also be necessary to preserve those elements of the previous Economic Order that have proven positive.

  **TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL**
  
  
  
  MADRID, September 10 (EFE).— Headaches are undoubtedly caused by the unlimited consumption of alcohol and tobacco, according to the morning newspaper "YaTanto". Alcohol and tobacco cause the dilation of the blood vessels in the brain, giving rise to the sensation of pain. The cure for this type of headache with painkillers can cause
  
  
  
  specific intoxications, consequently leading to dependence on those drugs. The author considers headaches to be a sign of other disorders such as a specific disease and recommends medical examinations to determine their intracranial origin.
