  _WITH REVOLUTIONARY HEAT._
  
  "This isn't a presentation, it's a reunion, which is taking place after almost a year, which is the year that Guillermo Thorndike has been the director of LA CRONICA," said the new director, Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada, in his speech to the employees of LA CRONICA. "And within the last year," he added, "we have remained connected through the determined, energetic, and revolutionary support that LA CRONICA has given to our work in Peru's Social Security." Similarly, he recounted the work the newspaper has done in the last 12 months. LA CRONICA has had a year of intense work. He said, "A year of gigantic effort, of journalistic effort, by LA CRONICA itself, by CRONICAWAN, by the magazine Mundial, by the VARIEDADES supplement, and by each and every edition of this publication." "It has been, I repeat, a gigantic effort. LA CRONICA is now the great newspaper of the Revolution. I'm not the only one saying this; it has transcended national boundaries and has reached the international arena." He then added that this has been the product of the work of each and every one of the newspaper's employees. He then added: "As for the line of this newspaper, its line will be that of the Peruvian Revolution. Because we are not only committed, we are militants." He then stated, "Middle positions are not possible. Either you are a revolutionary or you are not, because at this point, after six years of revolution, the uncertainty is inconceivable." He also recalled that on the day the President of the Republic, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, was sworn in, after he had finished taking the oath of office, a group of journalists approached him and asked, "And now what are you going to do?" "President Velasco responded with a single phrase: 'We will sweat.' This expression earned, at the time, a total lack of understanding in the pages of the reactionary and pro-oligarchic press." "However," said Dr. Gonzales Posada, "that simple phrase reflects the reality of the work of the Revolution, which has been reflected in profound structural changes." In conclusion, Dr. Gonzales Posada said: "I expect great collaboration from you: all your efforts to carry forward the newspaper of the Peruvian Revolution. That is all I have to say, and I thank you for the warm welcome you have given us."
  
  This is how Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada concluded his meeting. He then met with all the department heads and then toured the company's workshop facilities.
  
  **REVOLUTION OF THE DAY**PURISUNCHIS**
  
  _ONLY BY THE ROAD OF THE_REVOLUTION WE WILL CONTINUE
  
  Starting July 26, LA CRONICA, VARIEDADES, and CRONICAWAN have been working with a new director. That day, Guillermo Thorndike, our former director, cordially welcomed the new director, Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada, whom he then led to the newsroom where the newspaper's staff were waiting. Guillermo Thorndike then introduced the new director, Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada, to thunderous applause. Journalists, photojournalists, and staff members were present. Guillermo Thorndike briefly spoke, then said, "Now you should listen to him." They then embraced each other in a warm embrace. Afterward, Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada introduced the three members of the "Reorganizing Committee" that will accompany him in his administration: Dr. Jorge Larrea Ríofrio, Dr. Edmundo Solórzano, and Dr. Eduardo Gordillo Tordoya. Dr. Luis Gonzales Posada has assumed the position of editor of LA CRONICA, replacing Guillermo Thomdike, as appointed by the Revolutionary Government. From now on, LA CRONICA will report to the Presidency of the Republic.
