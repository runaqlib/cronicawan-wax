  The actions of counterrevolution and reaction often resemble tremors and earthquakes; they occur when least expected.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Earthquakes, almost always and because they surprise "everyone", tend to generate a panic that ultimately causes more damage than those generated directly by the tremor.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  A determining condition for tremors is surprise.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Likewise, counterrevolution and reaction tend to appear when revolutionaries are asleep—that is, when they confidently believe that everything has been achieved—or when the common task of all is left to other militants: the permanent vigilance of the revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At all times, at all times, the enemies of the people, the counterrevolutionaries, are preparing the next move, the next trick, to strike their blow, to sow panic, to destabilize the gains of the liberation struggle.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  To date, scientific development has not reached the point where it is possible to determine the exact day or time of an earthquake.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Likewise, the circumstances under which the counterrevolution will appear are unpredictable, as are its methods and how it will manifest itself next.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The task of revolutionaries, then, is to prepare so that the next move of the counterrevolutionaries doesn't surprise us; so that it doesn't sow panic in our ranks; so that it doesn't divide our forces; so that it doesn't destroy our gains.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Earth movements respond to the Earth's need to concentrate on itself, to stabilize itself.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The actions of the counterrevolution, of the enemies of the people, on the contrary, are the death throes of beasts, of wounded monsters. Of the resentful. Of those who once wielded over the people the power of a power imposed by terror, economic strangulation, and social discrimination.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Through these death throes—provocations, sabotage, terrorism, divisionism, overthrows, infantilism, or utopias—the counterrevolution seeks to recover its shameful kingdom of shadows.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The revolution, then, has the obligation to sleep with one eye open. It must always be ready to nip these death throes in the bud, saving itself the effort required to heal the ravages caused by counterrevolutionary maneuvers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Every militant of this revolution, the very embodiment of the Revolution, must therefore become a center for detecting tremors, an entity listening to pro-imperialist maneuvers and—consequently—the enemies of this process and this people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Only in this way, through combative, conscious, and militant vigilance, will we be able to counter the maneuvers of the enemies of our people. —And only backed by the weapon of that vigilance will we not have to lament the ravages that counterrevolutionary tremors have wreaked on other peoples, who just as continue to struggle.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **Maybe... maybe... maybe...**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Chaypasch… ch… ch…_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Hope is inherent to life. Without laughter and tears, no days are possible. Misfortunes are built or joys are realized on the basis of hope, and thus, since ultimate inertia is absurd, absolute defeat is impossible.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Human beings have sought impenetrable paths, darkness, parables, depths, designed utopias, strengthened fantasies, guided solely by the maybe... perhaps, maybe... perhaps, that is, doubt has motivated the quantitative and qualitative leaps of those who speak; those who heard of Marx.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It occurs to me that even science is nothing but perfectly rationalized doubt, perhaps verified, perhaps systematized. “I doubt, therefore I am,” might be the most
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  human of Descartes' “cogito ergo sum”.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  All this convoluted reasoning occurs to me on Abancay Avenue after buying a lottery ticket, with the open hope that fortune will be with me and change my life like through dark water, exhausted, defeated, but capable of sprouting, of still bearing fruit, of remaining faithful to its destiny.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There's no other way out of poverty than by abandoning oneself to the chance of the lottery or the hope of the lottery, taking risks to deceive oneself and mitigate with the maybe, or the perhaps, this stubborn lack of money. (Not to mention the single currency, as it's sky-high as it is.)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Perhaps man, by dint of realizing his misfortune, took refuge in doubt and/or hope, outside of absolute knowledge, refusing to adhere to any opinion. Perhaps the Greek skeptics, with their obscure names and obscure reasons, in the end, tired of their own rhythm, exhausted by their parenetics, did not doubt themselves. Even the word skeptic means to look carefully, just as hope is to give time to time, in both cases; caution and circumspection demonstrate the futility of things.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In both domestic life and partisan politics, the criteria of truth change with the dawning Leader. The words of false prophets are truths of absolute obsolescence; the only guaranteed voracity is that essential to existence. The truth of living and dying with the same stupor, supported by the same tear, decapitated by the same infamy.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For those reasons, I bought my lottery ticket. I don't expect it to be simple; my imagination doesn't go that far. However, a few tickets would be a unique event in the midst of this fever of giving time to time, this irrevocable way of sinking, and worst of all, with no possible replacement.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Maybe the lottery, maybe a big dick... something has to rally my desires, stop my fall, nourish me with the courage necessary to verify the latest data, those that prove a perfect record of failures.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  After all, parents know what I'm saying, because despite so many years of experience, at the end of every compromise, something as old and eroded as walking from shadow to shadow until the final gush of death, which is the absolute shadow, is discovered. PERIOD. Maybe it's true that I'm done, maybe, maybe...
