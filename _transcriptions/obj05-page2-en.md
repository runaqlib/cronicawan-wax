  **This is what FARTAC does in Cusco**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Kaymi Qusqupi FARTAC ruwasqan_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In Cusco, in the place called Huancaro, a large Fair was held this year, organized by the TUPAQ AMARU REVOLUTIONARY AGRARIAN FEDERATION OF CUSCO (FARTAC).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This fair was previously organized by the local farmers, grouped in the Departmental Agricultural Society.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For six years it was organized by the local bosses, who made the people see the peasants' work as if it were their own, but they, the bosses, never knew what it was like to bend down in a furrow.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  However, in 1973 this fair was organized by peasant companies and since 1974 it has been organized by FARTAC.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this reason, CRONICAWAN interviewed Aquiles Delgado, President of the Organizing Committee of the fair, who made the following statements:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.- What is the purpose of FARTAC in organizing this fair?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  AQUILES DELGADO.- FARTAC is on its revolutionary path, seeing the needs of Peru, the peasant businesses, on the lands that the Agrarian Reform has given them, is increasing food production and the number of livestock, so that our Peru no longer walks through suffering.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN: How many people attend this Fair?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  AQUILES DELGADO: Last year, 20 farming companies came, so there were plenty of stands. However, this year, many farming companies came, almost a hundred of them, and we have nowhere to put them. This fairground has turned out to be too small, so we are considering building a new fairground for next year.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At this fair, everything farmers work on is displayed. We have cattle, hair, pigs, everything farmers raise, and everything they grow—all kinds of food.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Seeing this, FARTAC has requested the following from the Agrarian Zone: "We, the men who work in the fields, are dedicated with one heart to improving the harvests, so that the poor men of the city can eat what the peasants work for.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  To ensure that the hungry have no place in the town, this Fairground must become a “Producers Market.”
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.- And would everything be sold there?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  AQUILES DELGADO.- There, all the peasant enterprises, all the Federation's bases, will bring their harvest every week, so that all the people of Cusco can buy it, not just the wealthy. Potatoes, beans, corn, wheat, barley, meat, cheese, milk—everything will be sold there.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.— What a huge amount of money was needed to hold this Fair.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  AQUILES DELGADO.- Last year, the Agricultural Development Bank helped us with 50 thousand soles, and the Ministry of Agriculture also helped us with 35 thousand soles.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Last year we achieved a profit of 154 thousand soles, and we donated that money to the Federation for its work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But this year, we have sadly seen that the Agricultural Development Bank is no longer helping us with those 50,000 soles.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That's why we ask ourselves: Why does the Agricultural Development Bank exist? It doesn't help this fair, and it doesn't help rural businesses.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.- As we know, in previous years this fair was organized by the local bosses, so now, you, the land workers and revolutionaries, feel free to organize it.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  AQUILES DELGADO: Since the Agrarian Reform gave us back the land, we have begun to work it well, without the orders of the local boss, taking our hearts in our hands, we are making the land produce better, without suffering, with a joyful heart, as one man.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This is how this Fair is, as the people of Cusco have seen, we have brought very good food, watered with our sweat.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Therefore, we must support and defend this revolution, following all its actions.
