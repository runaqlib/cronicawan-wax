  _FOREST FIRE IN SPAIN_
  
  Zaragoza, Spain, August 1975. (CRONICAWANPAQ) A forest fire has broken out across four thousand hectares of crops and pine trees, causing losses valued at approximately nine million dollars. The forest fire that affected the province of Zaragoza for four days and left everything completely burned was allegedly caused by an electrical spark that spread rapidly due to the prevailing winds, igniting the pine trees and destroying the crops. It even threatened two towns in the area, whose inhabitants were immediately evacuated. In order to extinguish the fire, Army forces, firefighters, the Civil Guard, as well as numerous volunteers, were present in the area. This disaster has caused enormous losses in money and materials, the amount of which has not yet been calculated, but it is believed to be large.

  _HOW DEATH CAME TO HIROSHIMA._
  
  On August 6, 1945, the atomic bomb exploded in the city of Hiroshima. As a result of that explosion, more than two hundred thousand people lost their lives. At that time, the so-called Second World War was raging around the world. The United States built a bomb, the atomic bomb, the deadliest of all bombs, the one that causes the most deaths. That bomb, even years after being exploded, continues to cause deaths in those affected. Its explosion occurs like a lightning bolt, with the brightness of lightning, and the heat it produces burns all people and things in the area of ​​the explosion. Thus, the United States built that bomb, and its rulers ordered it to be dropped on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. At eight in the morning on August 6, 1945, a plane crossed the city of Hiroshima and dropped the bomb. A flash of lightning occurred, killing more than 80,000 people in that instant, horribly burned and charred. The survivors have gradually died from the harmful effects of this bomb, and now number more than 200,000. Wherever an atomic bomb explodes, it destroys all signs of life, destroys everything humanity has been able to build, and the survivors acquire incurable diseases. Therefore, all people must oppose the manufacture of these bombs.

  _150 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE_FROM BOLIVIA.
  
  On August 6, Bolivia celebrated the 150th anniversary of its independence. On that day, 150 years ago, in 1825, Bolivia established itself as a free and independent nation. A great culture, known as the Aymara culture or Aymara people, once developed in its present-day territories. They built large buildings that still stand today. This people extended to the shores of Lake Titicaca, and their existence dates back to times before the Incas. At the time of the emergence of the Inca culture, and later in its development, they reached the Aymara settlements. After wars, the Incas emerged as victors, and the Aymara populations were integrated into the Taantinsuyo Empire. From then on, the Incas ruled these regions, which were called Qollasuyo.
  
  When the arrival of the Spanish, the Inca Empire was swept away, becoming a Spanish colony. At this time, this region became known as Upper Peru. In 1809, in the city of La Paz, Don Pedro Murillo rose up against the Charcas Court, in a clear act of rebellion. However, at that time, Viceroy Fernando de Abascal ruled Peru, and he ordered General Goyeneche to move to Upper Peru and suppress the rebellion. General Goyeneche defeated the revolutionaries of Upper Peru and apprehended Pedro Murillo, who was executed in the main square of La Paz as the person responsible for the uprising. When Peruvian independence was proclaimed in 1821 by General San Martín, the Spanish continued to rule Upper Peru. That's why, after the Battle of Ayacucho, in which the patriotic armies defeated the Spanish, Bolivar traveled through southern Peru and reached Qollasuyo, where the Spanish still remained. With Bolivar's arrival, the people of Upper Peru united and proclaimed their independence. In homage to Bolivar, they named the new Republic BOLIVIA on August 6, 1825. Since then, Bolivia was a separate nation; it was no longer part of the Peruvian nation. However, the bonds between Peru and Bolivia have always remained strong; we have lived together. That's why, today, as Bolivia celebrates one hundred and fifty years of independence, we rejoice with great joy, because we see in Bolivia a sister country. For this reason, and to highlight this event, General Francisco Morales Bermudez, Prime Minister of Peru, traveled to Bolivia, representing the President of the Republic, the Revolutionary Government, and the Peruvian People. Other delegations, including that of Venezuela, led by its President, and delegations from other countries, also traveled to Bolivia.
