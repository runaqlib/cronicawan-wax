  In the city of Cajamarca, Antonio Noblecilla Lavalle, a journalist working for the newspaper "La Crónica", was unjustly accused, this ruling being revoked by the members of the Supreme Court of Justice. Previously, the Mixed Correctional Court of Cajamarca, in the hearing of this case, accused the journalist of "La Crónica" for having written in his chronicles, reliable events carried out in Cajamarca, for which he deserved the sanction of imprisonment from this court, all of this as a result of the slander of the Prefect of Cajamarca. Hence, the Cajamarquinos courts sentenced Antonio Noblecilla to six months of imprisonment, for which he presented an appeal through the lawyer Dr. Raúl Peña Cabrera before the Supreme Court of Justice, decreeing his freedom.
