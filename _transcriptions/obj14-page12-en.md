  Being, only being and always being One alone before the Universe... Far from the other! To be as I was born, Far from time... To be as I feel, to be without any rose, to be eternal, to be a rotten stone! How I am dying: Poetry is what you are in my truth and nonsense. Give the body to a soul Give shape to the infinite, Give an hour to the time and the scream, And underneath Go with the fat river To I don't know where Maybe to the precipice. When you talk to you, say it without secretion, just be silent. If you spoke, the theory was made. If you remained silent, the murmur began. Don't NE SASeS, MY Genlo, don't worry, migromatica, Don't be scared, my hand. If there was consonance. Everything is real, even death. That is what affects us from the outside and inside. Continue serenely, myself. Life is this... longing! Poetry is the idea without an object The tail of the rat. Poetry is what I have leftover Poetry is what I lack Poetry is the hard thing, Or, only, a word Poetry is the God that stinks Or the woman that drags. Oh, Machu Picchu Poetry! It's my sense that I am nothing! To get to You, how much walking I had to do in leaps and bounds! Finally you are there, in your figure Of nakedness and disappointment, Deep in myself, telling me like the deaf mute, with my body and my embrace, With my pleasure With my horror My God! Why did it take you so long? I knew how to die, and I forgot. You know how to die, Stone, still. Dying is an eternal being In one life and in the other How many lives are there? The cat looks and looks, And says... (the shelter cat, Unintelligible, with the pupil) When will I be my neighbor without a world? When will my real life be? It was all belief or consent. Yes, without a doubt, it was all. Everything, everything, But not your stone. Accuracy in this world was the ugly truth.. And there are the strangers, recently erased from European universities. They were very sad, Faced with your horrible beauty. The excitement of returning or being given birth, But for conscience! ....
