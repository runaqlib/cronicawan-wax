If we look at the years that have passed, everywhere we will see the work of the Incas, and if we look at the years that will come, we will only glimpse the fruits of the Agrarian Reform. We come, in truth, from the great hearts of men of true strength, those who sowed the walls of ancient peoples. Of those who raised the temples of the gods. We are
  
  
  
  Like the seeds that never die, a river of people, we are a river of women who cannot be buried. The years of dark clouds are coming to an end. We don't believe that what so-called Western culture did could always have been good. How can that which made us suffer without mercy be good? Rather, now, we are just now reaching the spirit of the Incas, what the Incas did, their thoughts, their meditations. We are beginning again to put into our minds what the Incas did, so that with greater care we may walk the paths of our ancestors. In our people, what Western culture and Inca culture say run parallel. We come from Inca culture, we love Inca thought; it is our soul. Just as trees ripen their fruit with their blood, Inca thought and Inca work have ripened us. We must walk that path if we truly do not want to make mistakes.

  **OUR SPIRIT IS THE SAME**
  
  
  
  From this issue, we emerge beautifully attired. Our hearts are beating like fire, and with that heart we come to you. Thinking well, writing better, reading with dedication so that our blowguns do not err, so that our tongue is not the detestable tongue of the incense burner. We will speak the language of men, we will shout with one voice, neither poison nor mud will reach our faces, nor fatigue reach us, nor hatred crackle in our hearts. Speaking the truth, we have no reason to fear anyone. Yes, we believe in the Revolution. Yes, we think of our people; yes, we admire General Velasco Alvarado; yes, we will defend the people of Peru. That is, if we never forget the suffering of the poor. In that suffering our veins run wild, our eyes are only in them, our heart beats only for them. That's why we write, we write for them, for the small, the big, the fat, the thin, for all men, for the boys, for the girls, for the young, for all the future that is coming. Thinking of them we write first in Quechua, then in Spanish, we want everyone to read us, for everyone to know us, what we talk about, where we carry our wounds, where we carry our joys—that's how it is for us—we don't hide anything, on the roads we walk every day, what we meditate on, even our joys in the streets, even our daily sorrows, we tell them everything and we are here just as we are. You will say if we are wrong or walking the right path, that is what you will say.
