  **ANDEAN PACT**
  
  
  
  We have heard about the organization called the Andean Pact many times, and we have asked ourselves what the Andean Pact is, and why it was created. We will talk about that now. In the Andean Pact, six countries have come together: Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, and other plastics factories.
  
  
  
  These are the countries that make up this organization. They have gathered together, seeking to industrialize, so that the industry of each of these countries can develop. In addition, the products manufactured in these countries, in their mutual exchange, have preferential tariffs, and taxes are lower. These industries must be distributed among the six countries, to promote the uniform development of these countries. For example, if Peru were to build a plastics factory, then the other five countries would no longer be able to build other plastics factories. Colombia, Venezuela, etc.
  
  
  
  things, and they have to look for what kind of factories they are able to operate well, what they can produce well, but always observing that another country is not producing the same thing. Likewise, the Pact. An
  
  
  
  Dino contemplates mutual aid and cultural exchange between them. This Andean Pact is also known as the "Cartagena Agreement." We'll cover this for today; we'll expand further in the coming days.

  **SALVADOR ALLENDE TWO YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH.**
  
  
  
  Two years ago, on September 11, in Chile, President Salvador Allende was killed by soldiers. The Popular Unity coalition was led by Dr. Salvador Allende, and when it came to electing President, Chileans chose Dr. Allende as their candidate. Several parties were grouped in Popular Unity, including the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the MAPU, and other smaller parties that formed this coalition. Popular Unity won the elections and consequently proclaimed Dr. Salvador Allende President. He enacted laws such as the shan piñay wasipi wesq'as (Agrarian Reform), taking land from the local bosses and giving it to the peasants. He also nationalized the copper mines, Chile's main natural resource, so that Chile would own its mines. He also nationalized the banks. Because of these actions, the rich began to see him as a leader.
  
  
  
  with a bad eye and looked for a way to overthrow him, organizing strikes and other things, as did the lawyers, the doctors, the truck drivers. With that pretext, the Chief of the Chilean Army, Augusto Pinochet, overthrew the Popular Unity Government, where they killed Dr. Salador Allende. But the Chilean people, who supported the Popular Unity Government, took to the streets wanting to defend it. There, the soldiers killed many people, and later arrested many people who wanted to defend Popular Unity. 15,000 people have died this way, as well as many thousands more detained and locked up in jail. In light of this, people all over the world view Augusto Pinochet with a bad eye, and hold him responsible for the deaths of those thousands of people and for causing the suffering of all the Chilean people. Likewise, calls are being made all over the world to prevent this state of affairs from continuing, and to this end they have established organizations called "International Solidarity with Chile."
