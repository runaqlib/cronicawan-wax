  **OF THOSE WHO LIE**
  
  
  
  In every village, there are men who know the destiny of mankind; they see in their hands, in crystal spheres, unfathomable orb-like bodies through which one must travel. They warn of death in the stars, in distant constellations; nothing holds secrets for them. They are soothsayers, they call themselves astrologers. And there are those who believe... Have them, there are not a few, (there will be...
  
  
  
  They make their lives and destiny seem obvious to them for money. Scientists have completely refuted these witches. They have claimed they have no knowledge, they have said their predictions are lies, and they have also said that no rational person should believe in them. If these statements are true, why are there still astrologers in our land? Why are there not a few of them?

  **THE CEMETERIES**
  
  
  
  Our word is getting old, there is not enough time to talk about the subject. The world is divided into two parts; at the bottom are the poor men and at the top are those who accumulate wealth. With the poor and the rich, an entire world is also divided; there are opulent cats, and there are also kuna, kanmi qolqesapa cats who in their misery sleep on the roof of
  
  
  
  the houses; there are wealthy dogs, and there are also woolly and flea-ridden dogs. There are poor and thieving mice, companions in the misfortune of the poor, and there are white mice that live in gilded houses, they share the abundance of the pious. Similarly, there are cemeteries for the poor, dirty, forgotten, tarnished; there, only sometimes do flowers share the tears of men, there expelled corpses are eternalized, their anguish frightens us. And there are also sumptuous cemeteries, they are strangely beautiful, cared for daily, plastered with gold; there flowers grow, turning sorrows into joy, there corpses rest, bringing us inexplicable joy. That's right, even to die, you must have money. There are men who negotiate with death, who hoard riches with death. In Mexico, cemeteries are being built only for wealthy people...

  **OF THE TWO FORCES**
  
  
  
  Why did our hands unravel the lives of men in the night of time? Why, to live, must one shed one's spirit? Why death? Why dreams? Why revelry turns to black coals? Like a river that never ends, these questions could continue. Only two answers would put an end to so many questions: Like burning lava, man knows how to hate, and also like endless embers, man knows how to love; for these reasons, he is idolizer, and for these causes, he is jubilant. Since time immemorial, these two forces have made their source in the heart, gushing forth every day like an unstoppable fountain, as if it were a body that cannot be embraced, a faith that cannot be grasped, like a dawn that never becomes day. Of those two forces that boil like a constellation of expectations, love—love becomes cloudy, hiding everything from our eyes, or turning every shadow into clarity, simplifying difficulties, hailing alongside all the rains, summoning ashes from the embers. Such is man; for love he ages with the days, and only for tenderness does he paint the face white, of the years gone by. For love, the roots of flowers blush, and blacks turn black; only for love are seeds buried, and herbs of silence grow on stones. And hatred does not diminish the will of man; it disorients turbulent rivers when they flow, it turns the magnitude of the fire that burns in the sun into embers, and even sets ablaze the heights of hills covered in white snow.
