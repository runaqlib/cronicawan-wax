  **DEVELOP THE PROCESS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This methodology should stimulate decentralization in administrative responsibilities, thus allowing the dedication of more time to the political management of the process. The new methodology also implies the maintenance of direct and permanent contact not only through informative and clarifying dialogue with the population but also through real verification of their problems for their adequate solution. This methodology will also allow a significant part of the revolutionary effort to be directed towards the formation of the mentality of the new man that the society, which we are building and reva, requires.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  lorization of the dignity of the human person, a higher value around which it is necessary to start a crusade. To specify our scheme, it is necessary to deepen the process. But what is meant by deepening the process of the Peruvian Revolution? It is necessary to specify the meaning of our revolutionary language, thus avoiding erroneous or self-serving interpretations that distort reality and make frank dialogue with the people difficult. Going deeper, for us, does not mean directional detours; It is not changing our objectives. It means intensifying the initial actions to achieve the final objective in less time, an intensification that must be continuous, permanent and led to
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  adequate pace, because any Revolution that stops, advances slowly or irresponsibly accelerates, is destined to fail. Going deeper means reorienting the actions undertaken, if they have deviated from their purpose, recognizing errors and amending them. It also means starting the actions indicated in the Government Plan and not yet started. As well as specifying new specific objectives if they are going to meet the final objective of the Revolution. It also means applying quick and appropriate solutions to new problems that arise from the process itself, always orienting these solutions to the final scheme. It means, in short, strictly complying with the ideological postulates of the Peruvian Revolution, and thus achieving Social Democracy of Full Participation.

  **TWO TASKS TO ADDRESS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Revolutionary Government of Force. Armada wants to begin this second phase of the process on a blank page of history, so that all Peruvians have the opportunity to unite and contribute creativity, intelligence and action, in carrying out this process. The measure, adopted by the Council of Ministers in its first session, responds to this. We hope, therefore, that our intention and desire are understood. That we act within the norm already established in said agreement that the revolution is not forced to take painful measures for its defense that in this new phase will be irreversible. We renew the call for unity of all Peruvians
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  and we request the collaboration of the country's institutions so that within the broader channels of participation that are open today, they contribute with their knowledge, experience and participation in the construction of the new society. Compatriots: Two tasks of similar importance and priority constitute objectives that we have to address today: The continuation of efficient work to build the new society and the solution of the economic problems of our people that arise from the situation that currently involves all the countries of the world.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We have faith in overcoming them, a faith that is affirmed in knowing that we have a patriotic and hardworking people who grow in the face of difficulties; Forces, Navy and Police solidly united in defense of an ideal of a new Homeland; a National, Independent and Autonomous Revolution that is admiration and hope in America and in the entire world; and, above all, we also count on the desire of the men and women of Peru to forge a great, powerful, just and free country. LONG LIVE PERU! LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!
