  Nicomedes Santa Cruz evaluated the modulation of his voice with his mimicry. He explains skillfully and speaks easily about beats and absences. If he shelters himself with reminiscences, he is emphatic in his phrases, he retorts or affirms full of conviction or intimate of omens. His bushy mustaches have distinguished his face in Peru. Denied with rancor or applauded relentlessly, Nicomedes Santa Cruz is a man of punctual words and exact convictions. He takes his "blackness" like a soldier the battlements of his glory, he does not mystify it but he does not abandon it either because he knows that his life is there. CRONICAWAN, conversicon Nicomedes without cajon rhythm but with a cholo accent, with Peruvian fervor, it was a dialogue without tripping, a synthesis of the RUNAZAMBO that the country is still waiting for. HIS BEST UNIVERSITY HIS WORK AS A WORKER The cold that reigns dictatorially in the editorial office of LA TERCERA, stabs us from part to part. Cigarette smoke is just a sad attempt to keep warm. The recorder seems frozen, the cassette does not work according to the key requirements. After many attempts we asked the first question: WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE DECIMA AS A FORM OF LITERARY EXPRESSION? Having chosen the tenth is not a fortuitous or inexplicable fact, from very early on I lived urged by the need to express myself in verse. I think that at the age of 10 I tried various forms: The sonnet, the lyre, the silva, the hendecasyllables. It was a class coincidence that brought me closer to Porfirio VASQUEZ, whom I heard recite a tenth. I remember that my mother gave me similar recitations, I rehearse that
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  way of expression and I discover that I have a great facility for tenths. This happened around the year 1940. "I am making efforts to leave the tenth, it is valid as folklore, but it constrains me in thought. Nicomedes Santa Crua speaks like a river full of passion, it overflows as if we had touched the bud of his taste, he gestures, he fixes his glasses, he sips his cigarette with relish, he continues to talk: "I started writing tenths on the plans of the bars, I worked for 21 years As a blacksmith's apprentice, I went to school for six years. In the span of my life as a worker I did not pick up a single book, nor did I have contact with intellectuals, my entire field is work and everything I talk about are topics related to the occupation I have, what the life of workers is like: Daily work and conversation about the same. THE PEOPLE MORE TRUTHFUL THAN INTELLECTUAL CRITICISM Nicomedes Santa Cruz remembers his first contacts with Sebastián Salaza Bondy, he evokes those difficult years, his still untold paths, the first satisfactions, the rediscoveries, at this point of the reminiscences we pose the second question: SOME INTELLECTUALS CRITICIZE YOUR DESMEDIATE WANT TO JUSTIPIZE EVERY QUESTION TO PEOPLE OF COLOR? —Intellectuals interest me very little, I don't care. First; because the intellectuals never approached the people, the intellectuals are laymen, they are totally ignorant of popular activities. Second, I believe that the intelligentsia never considered me a poet, it would be wrong for me to take them into account.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It doesn't matter if they deny my status as a poet. The intellectuals have done me a favor by not considering me among their fauna. Because I am of popular extraction, I write for the people and the people agree with me BEFORE THE COLOR OF THE SKIN THE ISOLENCY OF DISCRIMINATION —I have overcome the stage of blackness, I had a tacist attitude out of rejection of the racist society in which we live, because Peru is a racist society. When I say black, I am also saying Indian, cholo, Japanese, I am covering an entire field of marginalized society in defense of that position, but when attacking the white there are some who feel white in the sense of socioeconomic position, they feel addressed, because white does not mean skin color, it means oligarchic position, pro-imperialist position, bourgeois position, anti-popular position. Even when there are critics with copper or black skin, their mentality is aligned by a white hegemony. Yo
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  THE TENTH UNIVERSAL SONG I go after the people, not in front, I put my poetry at the service of the people. The tenth is the most faithful form to the feelings of the great majorities of America. Corridos, joropos, and milongas were sung in tenths. The Cuban Revolution is being sung in Décimas, and the Decima has an increasingly positive and unifying force. ABOVE ALL PERU Nicomedes Santa Cruz speaks about the Decima, with the veracity and devotion of someone who knows its secrets, of someone who cultivates and sculpts it not only with words, but, above all, with behavior, with everyday attitude. Almost to say goodbye, he emphasizes again: "I feel Andean, Peruvian, rather than black, and I loved Peru above all things." In reality we had to extend this report in many columns and several pages, but as in Chocano's poem, we have to conchuir by repeating: "Otra vez sera" sera" (A.A.)
