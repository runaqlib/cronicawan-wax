They brought us entertaining things to watch, so that all the spectators would be happy with the things they do. Even before they begin to put up their tents, they engage the people to rejoice with them, so that we can see how much they do until the day they leave. Then they will raise their awnings and spread raje. That film is their walks to other distant towns. So that the days of their farewell are filled with tents, they walk everywhere calling out to the people. For that reason, in the streets of Lima, we are seeing the
  
  
  
  The joy of those who work in the circus. On those walks, their joy steals the hearts of the children, walking with their faces full of smiles. These days, not like in past years, when they repeat the same acts, now they too have released new ones.
  
  
  
  Ros, there are all kinds of working animals there. Those who make people laugh, the clowns, are also there.

CH'ERAJE Every year in the towns of Canas and Chunvibilcas, the people suddenly engage in battles as if they were just playing, and they end up in real combat. The people come out wounded from these battles, or end up killing each other, with their warak'as, with their liwis. The victors, after winning resoundingly, enter the ayllu of the losers and forcibly take the girls away. Neither the Civil Guard nor the laws can put an end to this way of life. Every year, people, suddenly during the days of Carnival, return to what they call Chiaraje, and as if they were people without a soul, they beat each other until they are tired with sticks, they hit each other, they sling each other or with bare fists, in what they call ch'iaraqe they play, a game of hate. That, Mr. Luis Figueroa, with the machine they call a video camera, having liked what people do, has only done with the truth.
  
  
  
  A film has dawned and he's named it Chiaraje. That film is made in Quechua, it just speaks the truth, it's made with a lot of love for the poor people, really when the years come they'll remember Chiaraje, from what Mr. Luis Figueroa did.

  _Kay saphiyuq Arequipa llaqtatan rayminpi sunquykuwanku. (We greet this town of Arequipa tradition with affection._

  Walking through the Kollasuyu, a general had said ARI QHEPAY, they say that's why they gave it the name Arequipa, a town of white walls, a town impossible to forget. In the town of Arequipa, song took root with the chants of Mariano Melgar, with the poems of Atahuallpa Rodriguez, with the songs of Guillermo Mercado; in Arequipa, the glare of the sun multiplies in beautiful life like beautiful grass. They say of Arequipa, it is a town that does not kneel, they say, nor does it greet those who make the people suffer. Arequipa is a town that spits in the face of tyrants with songs that never fade, it rises up for the cause of the people. That is why, throughout Peru, they love Arequipa, its workers, the peasants of Arequipa, all those who fight in Arequipa. The Revolution reached the Arequipe festival, carrying out all kinds of works, building houses for the townspeople, extending roads, extracting gold and silver from the heart of the hills, so that the people would work even harder, irrigating the land, so that the people would no longer suffer from hunger.
