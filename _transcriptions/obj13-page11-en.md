  **FRATICIDE WAR IN TIMOR**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  TIMOR, August 1975 (For CRONICAWAN).— Timor, is a town that is located in the middle of the sea, it is what we call an Island, it is located in what is called the Indonesian Archipelago. This Island of Timor is divided into two sectors: East Timor and West Timor.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  West Timor belongs to Indonesia. On the other hand, East Timor to date is still Colonia Poruiguesa: In this East Timor, there are two organizations in agreement, they are in favor of the liberation of Timor, their names are: Revolutionary Front for the Independence of Timor FRETENIN, is one, they want to make Timor independent immediately. The other is the Democratic Union of Timor UDT, they want the independence of
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Timor will take place little by little step by step and without breaking its ties with Portugal. From that, and by not agreeing, they are at war, seeing that, the Special Envoy of the Government of Portugal, and since Portugal cannot do anything, has asked Indonesia to intervene on the Island of Timor, in order to avoid bloodshed, so that peace is established and men in harmony can live in peace.
