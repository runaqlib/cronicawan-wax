  In the Middle East, nations live in a continuous state of war. These nations are Arabia and Israel. With the goal of safeguarding peace in the Middle East, the Army's "Peru Battalion" was sent to the critical area of ​​the Levant by agreement of the United Nations Security Council. They remained there for twenty months to preserve the ceasefire. They returned to their homeland yesterday, and their return was an emotional event, marked by joy and tears, along with the hearts of their families. Three hundred and thirty-three men, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Jaime Montesino Ampuero, dressed in the uniform of the UN Forces, arrived at eight-fifteen in the morning. As General Leonidas Rodriguez rightly stated, the mission accomplished by the Peruvians must be interpreted as the permanent vocation for peace of Peru and its Armed Forces in the Latin American continent, and particularly with respect to the sister countries that border Peru. We would like to always live with this peace and this joy.

  Selected astronauts from the world's two major powers will meet in space. They are Soviet and American astronauts. If the news had been spread in previous years, it would have been considered impossible. This dream will become a reality next Thursday. This event will take place, even though there will be lightning and tornadoes that raise fears about the success of the endeavor. With this event, a new era begins; knowledge of space will no longer be a matter of individual effort, because in every endeavor, unity will be strength. The quest to explore space has already been a task of several years; with this knowledge, humanity will be helped; this is the reason why your ships are perfectly equipped.

  General Juan Velasco Alvarado, to the young people gathered in Cusco, with his pristine voice, I write thus: I want you to think about the revolution. You have to work so that the revolution is irreversible, so that it continues forward, moving forward lightly, even more lightly. This revolution is being made for the youth. The young people have to contribute their strength, their heart, their blood. We have only just defeated the bosses; we still have to further clarify our thoughts and feelings so that our flag flies high, so that the revolution may achieve even greater accomplishments, so that our people may see the beautiful seed of the revolution, so that we may live a true life. With the words of General Velasco Alvarado, the young people have truly strengthened themselves; they have laughed and sung for our Peruvian people. The meeting in Cusco is showing us how the revolutionary youth are working just like their elders, for our people, for our Peru, for themselves.

  Colombian cultural and official organizations accused the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Bogotá of violating sovereignty, stealing national resources, and abusing and trampling on indigenous populations. The Summer Institute of Linguistics was founded by the United States and operates in virtually all Latin American countries, serving more than 500 indigenous groups, particularly indigenous groups. According to the plaintiffs, this institute performs functions other than linguistics, ignoring the laws of our countries. This institute owns airplanes, landing strips, and a radio network. Another serious accusation refers to the mass sterilization of indigenous and rural communities. We believe the Colombian entities accusing the institute are clear-minded: it is possible that they are performing similar functions in our country. It will always be dangerous for the United States to become men and to expand our concepts.

  The soccer players, wearing our flag on their chests. Eleven youngsters finished tied with the Chilean team. That's what they call a tie in Spanish. They played in the city of Santiago de Chile. The best kickers, who make up what we call the national team, flew to the southern country on a plane. Marcos Calderón is the one who teaches the youngsters so they can be even better kickers. In that distant nation, they couldn't win, but they didn't let themselves be defeated either. It was the young player Teófilo Cubillas, who, as the game was coming to an end, kicked the ball with precision, sending it wide. That's why the young Peruvians didn't emerge victorious. This month, they will play again, in Bolivia. They'll let us know how they'll play by radio.

  _ILLAPACHAY_
  
  The teachers who work in all the schools, among themselves, have chosen the leaders of their cooperative. There, two lists competed: Sutep and Serp. As we know, every year teachers hold elections, where they name their leaders, but in these elections, they insult each other in every possible way. They also insult our government, "telling it that it's starving us." But we believe they're insulting us only lip service, because that isn't, and can't be, true. The teachers, with all their intelligence, should have known this. On Friday, the schools didn't receive students because the teachers were holding elections. I hope these elections yield the best results, above all that the teachers live in peace and harmony among themselves, so that they stop being in constant war.
