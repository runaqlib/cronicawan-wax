  **SOCIAL PROPERTY IS COMING TO THE FIELD** Because we are living a true Revolution, what we say Social Property, which is an institution created by the Revolution, will reach the countryside. With this we will advance**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  truth to never let yourself be overtaken by hunger, ever. What is Social Property they say? It is as if he were a child of the Revolution, that exists only in our town, that has appeared only in our country. That distinguishes our Revolution, and that is why it is not like other Revolutions. Social Property is an organization where there are no owners, everyone works, and everyone also shares the product of their work. But everyone contributes their knowledge, their strength, their understanding and then, carrying out what we call a feasibility project, they put on the table of our governors, there the technicians who have a lot of understanding, if they approve it, the work immediately begins, and if they say no, then they go back to projecting in a better way.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But what we call profit is not going to be distributed in money, they will do everything for the community, houses, good houses for the men of the community, hospitals, playgrounds for the children to play, everything will be done. Our rulers will lend that money to the men of the community, so that they can return little by little. We will add much more about this, for now I will just talk to you about this.

  **THE REVOLUTION MUST DEEPEN EVEN MORE**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The foundations of the Revolution have not changed, its roots are the same, we will reach its most pristine postulates in this second stage of the Revolution. Our people must return to this stage of harmony, writers and intellectuals must speak in favor of the Revolution or questioning the Revolution, but they must do so with a man's voice, without backrooms, without accommodations, so that we know our errors. We must not praise a single man, nor repeat his name as the maker of all, we must not praise tirelessly. We must talk about the people, this war we wage against poverty, the grave we dig for the underdevelopment they say. A revolution does not stand in the hands of a single man, it walks on the backs of the people. This is what the person who has been leading our Revolutionary Process spoke about, for all the people of Peru. He also said, the Peruvian Revolution will deepen even more, that deepening is the fulfillment of the postulates of the Revolution, it is recognizing our errors, it is correcting our mistakes. But the Revolution does not falter in the freedom it fosters, nor does it weaken, nor does it walk in any way, nor does it crawl diminished, uneven, with only one foot. Rather, he marches with his flags undefeated, raising them to the height of the sky, he marches with his flags. All the people of Peru will find a better life with the deepening of the revolution, for that reason no one can defeat our Revolution. Long live the Revolution! Long live the Peruvian Country!

  The difficult days went quickly. General Francisco Morales Bermúdez, with his best science, will lead our people forward more quickly. There is no rest when working for the Revolution. It is not to rest to seek the time of justice. We walk on those paths, only on those paths should we continue, only on those routes should we march. In that battle against what we call underdevelopment, we cannot lose, it is impossible for us to go back, the days that come are ours, the fruits, life are in our hands. Meditating on that, we must unite even more around the Revolution. We will defend our revolution with our blood.
