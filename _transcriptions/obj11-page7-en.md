  **Hamawt'a José Lucas Caparó Muñiz**
  
  _The teacher José Lucas Caparó Muñiz_
  
  José Lucas Caparó Muñiz was born in the picturesque village of Quiqugana, Quispicanchis Province of Cusco, on October 18, 1845. A town of incomparable beauty on the banks of the sacred Willkamayu River, the place where he grew up, a mestizo town of noble aristocracy. Like Garcilaso, he had the dual ancestry of his integral mestizaje. His father, Don Manuel Caparó, a Sergeant Major in the Army, was of Spanish ancestry, and his mother, Doña Joseía Muñiz, the last cacique of Quiquijana, a direct descendant of the Incas. His home was undoubtedly the first school that taught him to exalt his Peruvian identity. With profound Peruvian mysticism, we pay homage to a great Cusco native of American significance, a scientist, a Peruvian scholar, Dr. José Lucas Caparó Muñiz, who was one of the pioneers of ethnological, linguistic, archaeological, and tourism studies in Peru and the Americas. Caparó Muñiz belonged to the brilliant generation of the Cusco Golden Age, along with other pioneers of linguistic studies on Quechua, such as Antonio Pacheco Zegarta and Leonardo Villar. Antonio Lorena, a disciple of Bertillón and Topinard, founded the Chair of Anthropology at the University of Cusco in 1896, a pioneer of anthropological studies in the Americas. José Lucas Caparó Muñiz stands as the precursor of Scientific Archaeology and National Tourism. This brilliant generation of Cusco intellectuals carried out a powerful PERUVIANIST movement that not only raised high the banners of the 1909 University Revolution, of continental scope, destroying all the colonial remnants of the Pontifical University of San Antonio de Abad del Cusco, but also carried out a true renewal of archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, sociological, ethnic, historical and artistic studies: the work of selective spirits such as Uriel Garcia, Luis E. Valcárcel, Alberto A. Giesecke, Rafael Tupayachi among others and the great musicians Leandro Alviña, Manuel and Roberto Ojeda, Juan de Dios Aguirre, Baltazar Zagarra and many other valuable figures. As a linguist, he dedicated himself to the study of Quechua. He wrote an Orthology and Syllabary and a special treatise on particles, affixes and grammatical accidents. He composed a Quechua dictionary with 50,000 entries, declensions
  
  grammar, verb conjugation, and a special key to facilitate the pronunciation of Quechua. In addition, he wrote a QUECHUA-SPANISH DICTIONARY of Quechua names and toponyms. He wrote notable plays, the most important of which are: HUASCAR in 6 acts, which refers to the civil war between Huascar and Ataalpa that facilitated the Spanish invasion. The notable drama Tito Qosñipa, in 5 acts, which refers to the rebellion of the Pumakanchis, who knew how to heroically hold out against the armies of Emperor Wiracocha, in the fortress of Waqra pukara, suspended over the Apurimac River, until its defenders were defeated and mutilated. The drama Ripac or Wiracocha, which refers to the confinement of the Heir Appointee by Yavar Waqaq, the invasion of the Chancas, the Battle of Yaar Panpa, and the apotheosis of Wiracocha Inca. His farce "Aventuras de Don Anselmo" and the zarzuela "Inti Raymi" are written in Quechua, Spanish. Also worthy of mention are the Spanish plays Vicios y Perfidias, a drama in three acts, referring to the final throes of colonization and the Pumacahua revolution. "El Obispo Ejemplas," premiered on the occasion of the third centenary of the University of San Antonio de Abad. His literary essay "Lacco" refers to amorous scenes between Spaniards and Inca princesses during the conquest. His monograph "Huascar Llagta," which refers to the traditions of the Royal Palace located on the shores of Lake Muyna. Critical judgment on the translations of the Gospels into Quechua by Clorinda Matto de Turner. "Notes and Traditions" are works of archaeological and historical content, scientific studies on the origin of the American peoples. "Family Customs" is of a sociological and ethnic nature. Worthy of mention are: "Official Report on the Inca and Colonial Monuments of Cusco" and "The Indian in Tavantinsuyu in the Colony and in the Republic." Special mention should be made of the scientific works of Caparó Muñiz on "Writing in Ancient Peru." After in-depth research, he considered KIPU to be the true writing of the Incas. He carefully studied the origin of this peculiar form of written expression, its structural characteristics, the size and colors of the threads, and the diversity of knots that constitute conventional signs that are not only mnemonic but also ideographic and phonetic. He was the first to confirm that there were two types of writing: a hieratic or sacred one, as in Egypt, with signs and symbols, and a writing based on kipus. This aspect is interesting, as it seems to reveal the keys to hieratic writing, based on decorative expressions found in petroglyphs, gellqas or oillqas, and in the decorative motifs of ceramics and textile art. He also established that the use of kipus had a dual purpose: the numeral kipu based on the decimal system,was used to carry out
  
  mathematical operations and, for statistics, which was the Key to the Inca Miracle. The Kipu as an abacus, computer or electronic brain, handled by expert accountants and, at a high level, by executives and planners, called Yupankis. Even to be Inca it is necessary to be Yupanki. The Kipu as Official Writer of the Inkorio, due to its complexity, was in the hands of other specialists, amautas, wise men, philosophers and had special privileges like the Scribes in Egypt. But the work of Caparó Muñiz has a very important facet in the patient formation of his Private Museum, from the time of the invasion to the present day. While the great museum of the Centeno ladies of Cusco was acquired by Germany and is part of the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, where Max Uhle's Perunism was formed. Later the great Macedo collection went to enrich the British Museum. Caparó Muñiz, who managed to establish a significant private museum, rejected all kinds of foreign offers and, with singular patriotism, at the suggestion of Dr. Alberto A. Giesecke, a pioneer of tourism in Peru, donated his museum to the University of Cusco for a symbolic sum: the foundation of the museum in America. Such, in a concise summary, is the life and work of the scholar José Lucas Caparó Muñiz, a Distinguished Honorary Member of Peruvian Culture and the Nation. And that today gravitates in the arcanid knots of sleepless neurons of his poetic lyre in imitation of the Harais of Oilantay, exteriorized in the following harai: Warma yanaytan chinkachikuniYaya Markapil Waqan vaqanmi mahkamushiani hahay oropiIchas kunturchu ichas phuyuchu pakaripuvany Ichas mayuchu ichas gochachu millp uripuvan Wañuy pachapi kasay pachapijlulunakusuny kuskallapuni purikusunchis nispa nivarqan Kunanmantaqa paqarinmanqay Wañusaqcha ri Mana yanayuq rikukuspa haqhay oropi Inti Taytayta Mamay killataany Waoharikuspa qaparikuspay Apukunata phutisqa Wañuyllatañan túkushiani Yaya Markapi. saminchanaypay Qampa armanasqa, Llald llakipiy sunooy important Anthropological Museum of the Archaeological Capital poets and historians, called KIPUKAMAYOQ, with
