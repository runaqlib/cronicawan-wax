  _THIRD GRADE EDUCATORS_WORLD WILL MEET IN MEXICO.
  
  MEXICO, July 1975 (CRONICAWANPAO) One hundred and four Third World countries will meet in Mexico for the "International Congress of Third World Educators," to be held from August 5th to 8th. This announcement was made by Carlos Jonguituq Barrios, President of the Organizing Committee for the event. The Congress is being subsidized by the National Union of Education Workers of Mexico.
  
  The 104 countries that have confirmed their attendance will have a voice and vote, and another 16 countries that will also attend the Congress will not. These latter belong to the so-called capitalist countries, some to some to socialist countries. The primary purpose of this meeting is to reject cultural aggression by the imperialist countries, as Carlos Jonguituc himself pointed out. At this meeting, the main topics to be discussed will be "Education and Economic and Social Development, Education and Culture, Education and International Solidarity." At the end of the deliberations, the conclusions reached will be known as the "Acapulco Declarations." Once the Congress is concluded, another meeting will be held, but this time solely for educators from Latin American countries. This meeting is sponsored and organized by the "Confederation of American Educators." Representatives from almost all Spanish-speaking countries will participate in this last meeting, which will be held between August 11 and 15, with the sole exception of Puerto Rico.

  _SELA WILL BE CREATED._
  
  PANAMA, August 1975 (CRONICAWANPAO) A ministerial-level meeting was held in Panama City, attended by 25 countries, 15 of which were represented by their Foreign Ministers. This meeting was held to lay the groundwork for the creation of a Latin American organization known as SELA (Latin American Economic System). As we know, in the American continent there are almost thirty countries, 25 of which are known as Latin American countries. Mexico called on these Latin American countries to form an economic organization composed exclusively of Latin American countries. Colombia and Venezuela joined this call, which is why this meeting of the 25 Latin American countries has been convened in Panama. The purpose of this meeting is to establish the foundations for the formation of this organization. To this end, a document has been approved.
  
  This document establishes the general guidelines that should govern the operation of SELA and the objectives of its formation. Among the most important aspects are: Promoting the creation of Latin American Multinational Enterprises: becoming a consultative and coordinating body for Latin American countries with international economic organizations. It also establishes that SELA will seek improved exchange of food and fertilizers among member countries, as well as protection of raw material prices, also promoting their transformation, and seeking adequate markets for Latin American products. Likewise, one of SELA's objectives will be to promote technical exchange, technology transfer, and scientific cooperation among Latin American countries. To structure the relevant document, the Ministerial Consultative Meeting agreed to appoint a High-Level Working Group, which should complete its work within two months to begin discussion of the relevant mechanisms. This document should reflect the opinions of all SELA members so that this organization can respond to the needs of its creation.

  _PORTUGAL: FIGHT TO THE DEATH_AGAINST CAPITALISM.
  
  LISBON, July 1975 (CRONICAWANPAQ) General Vasco Goncalves, Prime Minister of Portugal, declared that: "Portugal is determined to fight capitalism to the death." He stated this at a meeting of all the unions held here. General Goncalves called on the workers to remain united and avoid divisions within their ranks. If a division among the workers were to occur, the revolutionary vanguard would be isolated. The Prime Minister also indicated that the revolutionary vanguard is composed of the unity of the Armed Forces Movement and the workers. Likewise, General Goncalves stated that "We wish to establish a popular government in the future and the beginning of a cultural revolution. Likewise, it is necessary to modify the State apparatus, with the participation of the workers, so that they can control the operation of both state and private enterprises."

  _IN CUBA THEY REMEMBER_TO OUR COUNTRY.
  
  HAVANA, CUBA, July 1975 (PL) The official Cuban newspaper GRANMA, on the occasion of the celebrations of Peru's National Day, publishes the following: Cuba recognizes Peru as a sister country. For that reason, we find ourselves united, as one, with the Peruvian people and with the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces headed by General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Peru joyfully commemorates the 154th anniversary of its national independence, snatched from Spanish colonialism. The newspaper Granma adds, "Since the beginning of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, Peru has begun a new life, fighting with all its might for its political liberation, with a patriotic and anti-imperialist attitude." GRANMA concludes by saying: "The Cuban people wholeheartedly wish great achievements for the Peruvian people, and that the steps they take on the path to liberation may be eternal."

  _BLOCKADE ON CUBA LIFTED_
  
  San José, Costa Rica, July 1975 (From our news services). -- The Organization of American States, OAS, favorably resolved the Peruvian position at the Sixteenth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, held in San José, Costa Rica. At that meeting, Peru was represented by General Miguel Angel de la Flor Valle. For three years, Peru had raised the need to lift sanctions against Cuba, but this proposal has not been implemented to date due to the continued opposition of the United States. For this reason, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, and other nations remained committed to achieving the lifting of the sanctions, a goal that has been achieved today by obtaining the necessary majority. The lifting of sanctions against Cuba, observers maintain, represents a clear triumph for Peru's position. At this meeting of Foreign Ministers, the decision to lift sanctions against Cuba was made with the favorable vote of 10 nations, three voted against, and two abstained. With the lifting of sanctions against Cuba, this country is now ready to reestablish diplomatic and trade relations with all countries of the continent on an equal footing. For this reason, on behalf of the Peruvian people, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, and himself, General Juan Velazco Alvarado, President of the Republic, has sent congratulatory greetings to Commander Fidel Castro and the people of Cuba.
