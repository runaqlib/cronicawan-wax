  **This is how the lands were handed over in Cusco**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Aqnata qusqupi, allpata rakiranku_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With much gathered on June 24, 1975, in Cusco, Minister Rear Admiral AP Alberto Jiménez de Ludo, on behalf of the Revolutionary Government, handed over land to 29 peasant companies.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That day, 112,119 hectares were handed over to 3,240 farming families at the Huancaro Fairgrounds.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this reason, many peasants and land workers gathered in Cusco. Many thousands of peasants gathered there.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  On that occasion, Bruno Cabrera spoke as Secretary General of FARTAC, who, addressing the farmers, said:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  On this day, our hearts are happy; today we will receive the land. On those lands, the local bosses made us work for nothing. They stole our labor. There they killed and slaughtered people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  “Today marks six years since the Agrarian Reform. That law was passed on June 24, 1969. It was also declared “Farmers' Day.” That's why we rejoice.”
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "But there are still bad authorities, bad teachers, and Civil Guards who support the rich and beat the peasants with their clubs. That's why we must stand together as one, to demand respect."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now let us work with a good heart, making the land productive, taking our products to market, so that the people of the city have something to eat.”
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Then, Rear Admiral AP Alberto Jiménez de Lucio proceeded to hand over the lands to the peasants, after which he spoke thus:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The land is a social asset, because not only you, the farmers who work it directly, but ultimately all Peruvians depend on the food it produces. This, fellow farmers, is the great, hysterical commitment that farmers make to the nation.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In Cusco and at the national level, between 1975 and 1976, the latifundio and minifundio regimes will no longer exist; that is, the stages of appropriation and allocation of the Agrarian Reform will be considered concluded.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The highland provinces of Canas, Canchis, Espinar, Chumbivilcas, and the rest of the department of Apurímac will conclude the Agrarian Reform process, making a reality, within legal channels, of the principle that the land should belong to the man who works it, a guarantee of his dignity and freedom.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  “The new agrarian order presents challenges to the creative capacity for diversification of activities, using the potential of natural resources and labor in a revolutionary manner at the company and regional level, in a calm manner and with the commitment of militant peasants of the Revolution to contribute to the extent of our possibilities to the improvement of peasant enterprises within areas of rural development. A revolution that seeks to give a sacramental character to the institutions it has created is already a dead revolution, therefore, the dynamism of diversification of activities in the benefited areas is necessary, always within the conceptual framework of the ideological basis with which the change of the country's structures is being carried out.”
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "It is understandable that this has driven despair among the agents of imperialism and capitalism, and among the former masters who enjoyed the privileges and benefits of the land. Less understandable is the despair of a delirious "ultra-left" that seeks to drag our peasant brothers and sisters, through hatred and violence, beyond the reach of the law and into a fratricidal struggle. This must compel peasants to reflect deeply, especially their leaders, who bear a historical responsibility for not allowing themselves to be drawn into this conspiracy of the sick ultra-left, which seeks to distort the process and generate violence, which the government of the Armed Forces must in no way permit."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  To conclude this celebration, all the peasants gathered there paraded in front of the Minister and, showing their joy, performed traditional dances and songs, which they performed with great joy.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This was "Farmers' Day" in Cusco. This is how it was celebrated.
