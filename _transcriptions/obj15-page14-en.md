  **THE TIAHUANACO (I)**
  
  
  
  On the shores of Lake Titicaca, a people still die in their memories. In those desolate fields, in the cold, they are still weaving their years; in that solitude, their dreams continue to bloom, there the roads only end in our eyes. For us, only two universes stretch out: ours, an endless plain of sadness; and the sky, a disordered field of stars. There is nothing else; only the wind and the straw recount the anguish of mankind. It is enough, for what more? Like an immense column of these two universes, the people of Tiahuanaco turned their roots to stone. There, men joined with gods unknown to our eyes. There, they built the temple of Calasasaya; unfathomable paths of stars still cling to its door. They say Tunapa created the people with his word; they say that before that, he carved giant men in stone, and from there, he plunged them into an endless night. Thus the books tell us. Rectifying his work, he made dawn break again, and men awoke from their dreams...only their constructions do we know, only their footprints, their stony hands...

  **OF THE KNOWERS OF HEAVEN**
  
  
  
  Knowing the sky is no simple task. It is difficult to clarify the night of the heavens, and it is also difficult to follow the sidereal paths. Unraveling the mystery of the starry nights is still difficult today, much more so in the past without auxiliary means, only with the eyes; seeing only with the brain meant unraveling the most complex of skeins. But as complex as it necessarily was to face it, freeing oneself from this difficulty was to aid agriculture, to know the years and months. The sun, the stars, and all the morning stars have known paths, numbered days; this taught men to know their time, to know the time of sowing, the time of harvest, and also the time to save the seeds. It was the priests who knew most about the heavens. They engraved their knowledge on vessels, on the walls of temples, so that it would remain as a sacred calendar. The Nazca people had astrological knowledge; they knew various constellations. They knew—so experts say—the constellations of the bird, the monkey, etc. They also knew the sun and the stars. The inhabitants of Nazca marked out this knowledge, these paths, on the Nazca plains, on the plains of Ingenio. They remain so to this day—but we look like blind men—what they say, how they read them, we still don't know anything; but they are there, and they will remain there forever. Whatever the task, they had!
