  **REVOLUTION OF UMALLIQ**POLITICS.**
  
  _Political Organization of_the Peruvian Revolution.
  
  A proper approach to these problems is particularly important in relation to the emergence of the political organization in which our Revolution must find original and creative expression. We do not attempt to forge a political structure to serve the men of the government and destined to be the subject and object of manipulation. We conceive of this organization as part of the development of new institutional forms of participation in Peru. As such, it will be, for us, a fundamental aspect of the political structure of the future Peruvian society. Therefore, it is important that, in forging the organizational structure of the Peruvian Revolution, we be careful with respect to the means we use in its implementation. Only by being consistent with the supreme objectives of the Peruvian Revolution can we succeed in the difficult task of creating a political organization that corresponds to its ideological foundations. The political organization of the Peruvian Revolution, the sole sphere of our activism, will emerge according to these general guidelines. It will act as a guiding force for the Peruvian people, in competition and struggle with the other political groups existing in the country. Only by strengthening our ideological militancy will the new organization be able to foster true political militancy. Herein lies its main task and its greatest historical challenge. In announcing to the country the creation of the political organization of the Peruvian Revolution, which will emerge from the grassroots of our people, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces expresses its confidence that it will decisively contribute to consolidating the autonomous development of the process.
  
  **TECHNICAL POLICY.**
  
  _APPROACH TO RENOVATION_OF THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE.
  
  Progress has been made in both areas, but these sectors have not been a priority within the Government's action to date. With many of the tasks that represent a large part of the Armed Forces Government's program completed or in the process of being completed, it is necessary to direct a considerable part of the national effort toward the problems I have just mentioned. Another important aspect of our action in the immediate future must relate to the strengthening and expansion of the Socially Owned Sector. In this regard, the Agricultural Production Cooperatives, the Agricultural Societies of Social Interest, and the Peasant Communities, after some organizational modifications, must be integrated into the new sector or together with the socially owned enterprises themselves. This will make it possible to significantly and immediately strengthen the socially owned sector. Twenty-nine socially owned enterprises are currently operating in eight sectors of our economy. These enterprises will employ forty thousand workers in fourteen different departments of the country. The strengthening of the Social Property Sector must be accompanied, within the political sphere, by the consolidation of new forms of local government that obey a participatory, that is, authentically democratic, approach. We must begin to renew the country's political structure from its foundations, one that more genuinely responds to the demands of the Peruvian Revolution and the true aspirations and needs of our people. This means contributing to establishing the foundations of a new political system, forging local government bodies that authentically express the sentiments of the population. These general guidelines must be transformed into concrete proposals as a result of the study and analysis that different sectors of the government will undertake. Herein lies clearly one of the main tasks that the Revolution must begin to fulfill immediately. It is of fundamental importance to strengthen the authentic participation of the people of Peru in defining their destiny. Grassroots autonomous institutions, participatory local governments, and the political organization of the Revolution are all part of the same effort to lay the foundations for our future fully participatory social democracy, as a completely new global political structure consistent with the great humanist, libertarian, and socialist ideals of the Peruvian Revolution.

  THE EXPROPRIATION OF MARCONA
  
  Finally, in recent days, the Revolutionary Government expropriated Marcona. The production of this rich iron deposit now belongs to Peru. Marcona was discovered in 1903 and began operating fifty years later. Its current production is more than nine million tons annually, with a value of three and a half billion soles. Its proven reserves are two hundred and eighty-six million tons of ore with secure markets worldwide. By adopting this historic decision and thus continuing to recover Peru's natural resources, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces continues to apply the Inca Plan as the standard of Peruvian politics. The expropriation of Marcona is an important advance of the Revolution. It strengthens our nationalist policy and contributes to Peru's development by reinforcing our national security on the domestic economic front, while also satisfying a long-standing desire of the Peruvian people. In connection with this fundamental achievement of the Revolutionary Process, the Government's plans include the construction of a steel plant for the refining of Marcona iron ore, which will give a new and decisive boost to our steel industry. The Ministries of Defense have continued to make a significant contribution to the country's economic development by collaborating extensively in oil and mining exploration, the construction of the oil pipeline, highway construction, jungle colonization programs, and the provision of various types of health and social services throughout the country. Finally, the new Mandatory Military Service Law fills a gap from the perspective of National Security. The aforementioned projects are essential for achieving Peru's effective development. But carrying them out necessarily entails sacrifices and the inevitable postponement of other tasks. The Government of the Revolution must therefore set priorities and adhere rigorously to them. Therefore, we are only just beginning to direct our preferential attention toward problems that until now have not been able to attract the Revolution's predominant interest. In this sense, to the enormous effort devoted to education and the priority already established for food production, we must now add the determination to concentrate our efforts on solving the problems of health and housing.

  _Militancy in the Peruvian Revolution._
  
  By attempting to hide or minimize these fundamental differences, they have sought to undermine at its root the possibility of authentic militancy in the Peruvian Revolution. Because without a convinced, loyal, and profound ideological militancy, there can be no true political militancy. And without both, our Revolution would be at the mercy of the penetration, influence, and infiltration of groups and parties that are undoubtedly our political adversaries and competitors. This leads us to consider the delicate problem of defining the factors and forces of opposition to the Revolution. In this sense, we must be aware that our adversaries are located at various levels and planes of action. At a certain level, foreign economic power, in alliance with the oligarchy and other internal counterrevolutionary groups, is our principal adversary. This is a fight for the survival of the process, because here we are dealing with the only adversary capable of mobilizing sufficient forces to create problems of intense gravity for the Peruvian Revolution. On the equally decisive level of concrete political competition, there are different opposition forces and different adversaries. Here, it is a matter of fighting to maintain the identity of the Peruvian Revolution to preserve it from the grave dangers of ideopolitical deviation. And on this vital front for the future of the Revolution, we must fight against the activists of all communist groups and the APRA (National Action Party). This is essential to guarantee that our Revolution will never stray from its course. The widespread conservative, authoritarian, and ostentatious bureaucratic spirit that characterized traditional society represents another important adversarial factor. Because that spirit still lives and will continue to live for a long time. We have encountered it and will continue to encounter it as an obstacle to the development of all revolutionary transformations, weakening their momentum and distorting their meaning. If that spirit were not displaced by the Revolution, it would be profoundly denatured, to the point of losing, for this reason, its very identity.
  
  Consequently, it is against each of these adversaries that we must constantly fight, without confusing the planes of struggle and without diminishing the importance of any of them. This is what many would like us to conceal. Because there are political interests that are not in favor of the affirmation of our full autonomy, nor of the rooting of the Peruvian Revolution in the consciousness of our people as a position distinct from and superior to everything traditional political thought has expressed in the past and continues to express in the present.

  _Anti-Peruvian Campaign Complaint._
  
  Regarding the international arena, however, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces finds it necessary to once again denounce before the Peruvian people and the countries of Latin America the continued campaign by imperialist agencies and Peruvian reactionary groups abroad that infamously and slanderously attribute warlike and aggressive intentions to Peru. By reiterating this public denunciation, the Revolutionary Government once again appeals to the conscience of the peoples of the world and the international press to stop falsifying the truth about Peru and sowing discord among fraternal peoples. Peru absolutely rejects this irresponsible campaign and reaffirms its policy of peace with all Latin American countries. We harbor no animosity toward anyone and will never initiate any aggression or act of provocation against any sister nation. We invite the countries with which we maintain diplomatic relations to, through their embassies or military deputies, which have always had full freedom to carry out their official activities in Peru, to state whether there is any truth in the mendacious campaign that presents us as a country on a war footing and about to embark on aggressive adventures. And to also state whether there may be truth in the treacherous version according to which Peru has Soviet military bases and military advisors of Russian, Cuban, Yugoslav, and Chinese nationality. It is no longer possible to tolerate the delirious and criminal intentions of those who underhandedly seek to pit the people of Peru against neighboring countries with whom we should always live in peace, because peace does not exist with any other.
  
  They have no cause or reason for discord. The only war we are engaged in is the war we began on October 3, 1968, against underdevelopment, poverty, and injustice. We are devoting all our efforts to this war. And we are waging it victoriously. We want to continue living in peace because only in peace will we achieve final victory in this struggle. This does not mean that we are not always ready to defend our integrity and our sovereignty.
