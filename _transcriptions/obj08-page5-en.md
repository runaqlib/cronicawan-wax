  _QUECHUA IS ONLY ONE_
  
  The men of the town, the people who write, ask each other: what language are we going to speak: The language of Cusco, the language of Ayacucho, the language of Apurimac, that of Andahuaylas, or perhaps that of Huancayo? The law says: Quechua, and Quechua is only one, here or anywhere else, Runasimi, is the language of the Incas, the one they spoke before the Spanish had arrived, the language that
  
  Our people spoke in ancient times. The law doesn't say, speak the Quechua of Cusco, nor does it order that you speak the Quechua of Ayacucho, it makes no reference to the Huanca language. The law says: The most correct Quechua is the one that has been made official, just like Spanish. We must think about this mandate of the law, we must meditate, until we arrive at a correct reasoning. If we don't proceed in this way, we would not be speaking about our people, we would not be speaking a single language, again as before time there would be an anarchy of languages. We must see Quechua as a single language, just as we received it from our ancestors, from men of remote generations. That language is the one we must speak and cherish with the greatest goodwill. But, yes, among ourselves, among the people who truly speak and write in Quechua. There are thinkers, with great intelligence, but they are not like the men of the people; they speak two languages, they speak to their books and from their books, they speak Quechua from outside. Since there's already a newspaper in Quechua, we should speak in that newspaper, putting our best effort into it, carefully organizing our thoughts, and looking out for our people. Cronicaan will publish everything you say.
  
  **HIGH LEVEL COMMISSION**RUNASIMIPAQ LLANKASQANTA RIASICHINQA**
  
  _THE HIGH LEVEL COMMISSION WILL DARA_TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN WORKED ON IN QUECHUA
  
  As we know, the Revolutionary Government, when making Quechua official, issued Decree Law 21156. It also ordered that the most enlightened professors be chosen, so that by meditating among themselves, so that by thinking among themselves, they would obtain a script for Quechua.
  
  In this High-Level Commission, the following are working: Emilio Romero, Alberto Escobar, Alfonsina Barcionuevo, Nelly Castrat, Demetio Tupao Yupanqui, together with other professors, to achieve and master the way of writing Quechua. Our leaders have ordered that they complete their work within 45 days. That deadline is already coming to an end; the day is near for the High-Level Commission to hand over what it has worked on to the people, so that the writing of Quechua becomes uniform, so that the anarchy in writing Quechua disappears. But there are those who say that there are too many Quechuas. What do those in the High-Level Commission think? We will have to obey them; we will listen to what they say, so that we do not make mistakes, so that we write reliably in a single script, so that we can read each other reliably, so that we can speak equally. Since they are among people whose thinking is pristine, they cannot make mistakes. They will have meditated very carefully, they will have already looked with unequivocal perspective at where the best Quechua is spoken, so that, drawing on that experience, they can buttress their affirmations, so that their affirmations and assertions are truly solid and firm. As we already know, the runasimi is present in the hearts of the people every day, but it does not live hidden in the hearts of books. We must see the runasimi bubbling in their existence, on the lips of the living, in the joy of the poor. We must see it in the sadness of the people. We must see the runasimi beating in the anonymous mass of the people, in their endless veins. We make only this request. The people must now know what the High-Level Commission is working on, so that the people may comment on it, reflect on that work, praise what the High-Level Commission is doing, or censure what is poorly done.
  
  It is the people themselves who, with their speech and their thinking, must be present in the High-Level Commission, vigilant, meditating, and watching what the Commission does. And since the High-Level Commission works for the people, in the end, only the people will impose their particularities. Now, the eyes of the people are focused on what the Commission does; all Quechua speakers are waiting for what the Commission members have thought and meditated on. What the Commission says will be eternally remembered by the youth. The people will keep in their hearts the Quechua script that is well suggested. Let us hope that what the High-Level Commission is working on reaches us.
  
  FROM THE WORLD NOISE AND OTHER REEFS
  
  Aside from literary flourishes that hide flaws, the unpleasant task of examining the right of famous writers to suicide is always fascinating. That taking of life by one's own hand, that submissively allowing death to overcome it, gathering it with a gunshot or pursuing it until it plunges, as Leopoldo Lugones or Alfonsina Stornin did. While it's true that every literary history is almost always a success story, it's also true that failures are almost never reported, the greatest of which is suicide, the final and definitive setback for someone who couldn't handle misfortune. For a writer, it's an implacable defeat to live glued to directives, perhaps that's why they seek in a bullet the freedom that is so essential to writing. Writers who know how to provide countless answers to the world, when they can't find the innermost question they seek in their lives, prefer the ultimate escape; that's how they differ from politicians. While the former know only one loyalty, the latter are always satiated with any place and with any master.
  
  The writer mocks everyone with a joyful, substantive delivery (Don Francisco de Quevedo comes to mind), both seriously and jokingly. A literary work is ultimately the mirror of a corpse, whether of the writer's dreams, of the reality described, or of the adventure that couldn't be lived; even science fiction is nothing more than a way of murdering our time. The only one capable of stripping away his feelings or disguising his masculinity is the writer, for whom the world is a perfect hoax, even at its most solemn moment. Politicians don't mock; that's why they crawl, suggest, offer their knees, their ruins, and end up interviewing themselves with their own caricature. The list of suicidal writers is very long: José. Asunción Silva. Medardo Angel Silva, Mayakovsky, Stefan Zweig, Hemingway, José María Arguedas—names that jolt the memory as I write this note, amidst the infernal noise of the newsroom and my compadre's laughter. Perhaps for suicidal people, the grave is the only flicker of light; perhaps that's why they direct their steps there or enjoy searching for it in a stubborn and foreboding bohemianism, as did Sérvulo Gutiérrez or the huanca Villanueva, who drank only to celebrate their anonymous popularity for knowing they were left behind. What a remarkable world ours is, where destiny is so meekly resolved, and where intelligence, no matter how brilliant, needs two coins, many decisions, and a few statues to continue subsisting. The rest is a matter of gatherings that don't make it into literary histories. Antheaume and Dromard, in a study they did on poetry and madness, said when speaking of Gerard de Nerval. that with his suicide he hadn't died, but had transmigrated, perhaps (again the adverb of doubt) because poets see with their imagination what they resist certifying with their eyes. In any case, injustice and loneliness disturb the personality of the poet much more quickly than any material torture. A fact that made a philosopher from my village exclaim: Why are we born poets, why aren't we substantially merchants? (I was exhausted of ideas because I just saw the LORD! paymaster.)
  
  UNTIL WHEN, HUAYANAY?
  
  For how long will the stubborn, legal harassment of the Huaynay peasants continue? Not only is the delay in a dubious opening of the process lamentable, revealing the profound absurdity of a justice system blind to reality. Even more serious is the continuation, one after another, of irregularities and abuses. A judge who, instead of establishing what is clarifiable, gets lost in fabrications about four arrobas of chuño. The delirious loss of provisional freedom of a peasant for the atrocious crime of having traveled to Lima to offer his oath of allegiance to the flag and having marched with thousands of Peruvians in front of the government house. Acts of violence in the middle of the courtroom, without the authorities batting an eye. A list of irregularities in the Huayanay affair would be so outrageous that it only remains to ask: Do these events occur precisely because the Huayanay case is a case of national dimensions whose protagonists have earned the ire of the local justice system, or is this simply normal procedure in the most remote corners of our country? We would like to believe that it does. First: that a handful of authorities subjected to public scrutiny and condemnation employ petty forms of revenge. Unfortunately, the reality could be different. So much rottenness is revealed in every thorough investigation into similar events that it's easy to believe that the Huayanay case is just one—the most notorious, the most prominent—in a long list of cases with similar procedures.
  
  LUGIDEZ DE RUIZ ELDRIDGE
  
  The tribute paid to Alberto Ruiz Lildredgo last Monday had a double significance: on the one hand, the support shown by the majority of the media to one of the most enlightened militants of the Revolution; and on the other, what was said at that meeting. In particular, the intervention of the honoree himself reached levels of masterly, serene, lucidity, and revolutionary optimism. With pedagogical clarity, he placed the Peruvian Revolution within the global revolutionary context and pointed out not only the identification of our process with an unstoppable universal historical current, but also the contribution our Revolution makes to world history. In this context of general historical trends, he pointed out the extremely high improbability that our own autonomous Peruvian process will deviate down paths back to the unjust situation. Only the most insane insanity could lead to such a choice: there is nothing in our Revolution that could justify alliances that would only lead to corruption and the entrenchment of "small sectors... that mean nothing and would actually lead to the destruction of our beautiful process."
  
  THE POPULAR INITIATIVE
  
  Yesterday's newspapers did not give sufficient importance to information that, however, is of profound importance:
  
  Thanks to the initiative and participation of workers, the quality of Siderperu's ingot molds was improved. The new technique will save the company 50 million soles a year. The magnitude of the advance is not the only thing that is significant. What is truly transcendent are the implications of the matter. On the one hand, it reveals the capacity of rank-and-file workers to innovate technological procedures that are normally considered the preserve of specialists and high-level technicians. Secondly, the case implies a demystification of "imported technology": in reality, what they've sold us is machinery that wastes 50 million a year. Thirdly - and most importantly - the case demonstrates that the initiative of workers who adopt a participatory attitude, a new kind of connection with their workplace, can generate optimal results. Let's remember that ours is a country with scarce human resources (in the traditional sense): we cannot afford to waste enormous potential like that demonstrated by the Siderperú workers. The fact, however, is that this potential cannot be developed in a capitalist enterprise, due to the very characteristics of that mode of production. In a state-owned enterprise, only with great revolutionary lucidity can the conditions for this occur. It is in a socially owned enterprise that the doors to initiative will best be opened. At least to the extent that they retain their fundamentally participatory autonomous structure and do not adhere to capitalist organizational models, a natural and almost inevitable temptation. for the rest.
  
  There are still men with their heads in the air. They insult the poor every day, calling them "Indian," "Indian." These men have never considered their blood. There are no longer men of pure blood in the world. The blue-blooded gentlemen are gone. All blood runs mixed in our veins. Peruvians are Peruvians without distinction; there is no longer only Spanish, nor only Indian. It is the men of ragged blood who insult, calling them "Indian," "Indian." (A A.)
