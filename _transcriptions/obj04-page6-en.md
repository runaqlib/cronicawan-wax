  **### This is how the world we live in was formed.**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Hinatan pacha tiyasqanchis paqariran*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Have you ever wondered, in your wanderings or in the midst of your solitude, or perhaps when you looked up into the heavens; perhaps when you were ploughing the earth with your plow, how was this world we live in formed?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Have you ever wondered how Father Sun began to shine?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  How did the stars begin to shine?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Have you ever wondered how the moon, following in the footsteps of the sun, walks only at night?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Have you ever wondered, ever wondered, how the world we live in was formed?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Has it always been the same as it is now? Has it been as we know it today?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Have trees always flowered and produced the fruits we know today? Did the qantu always show us its flowers as toys?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Has it always been the case that the hummingbird, with its polychromatic flight, drank the soul of flowers?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Have rivers always quenched the thirst of the parched land?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Perhaps all their lives the beautiful eyes of the vicu√±as have been watching the song of the winds?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  And the puma, did it always stalk the meat it ate?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  What was the world we live in like then? How could it have been formed?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Without wanting to tire ourselves out, I would like to answer these questions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This is how the world was formed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the beginning, the entire universe was something like a big cloud, in which there were explosions. Because of those explosions, because of those great movements, the different worlds that we know were created. But I must tell you that they were not as we know them today.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Like an immense smoking bonfire, the sun was then just a sphere of fire, there were many spheres like suns, even now in an immensity that we do not see they exist.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  When these fiery suns exploded again and spread out again, the stars and the world we live in appeared.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But this world we live in was also another sphere of fire.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  As time passed, when countless years passed, our world began to cool down, giving rise to the world we live in.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But even in that world there was still no form of life. What could have lived in the midst of the embers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That is why this world in which we live was formed in periods, in epochs. These epochs are called eras.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These eras occurred over billions of years.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Only then did the most primitive forms of life appear. They appeared in the seas. From them emerged all the forms of life that we know today.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It was then that the earth began to be populated by gigantic reptiles. They later gave rise to birds.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Man followed a similar process. At first he was like an ape, he knew no work; he fed himself by gathering fruit from trees, later he made axes out of trees and stones to hunt animals to feed him.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That's how he killed the puma and the deer,
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I must tell you that this man did not yet know about fire; that is why he ate his food raw, exactly like foxes and pumas eat.
