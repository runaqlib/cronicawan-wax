  Those who slaughtered our father Tupaq Amaru, so that our people would suffer even more, ordered that they no longer speak the Runa Simi language, forbidding them from wearing the clothing of their people. Our ancestors, with these ordinances, truly suffered unspeakably. But our ancestors deceived the heartless Spaniards, doing as they ordered, and in their spirits they carried the language of the people, the footsteps of the people. That's what we do to this day, just lip service, some things are fulfilled and we say yes, yes and the heart beats for the reasons of the people, that's what is done in the celebration called CHIARAQ"E every year. That for the so-called cinema, has been made by our countryman Luis Figueroa, in his immense love for the people, but, the supporters of the Spanish do not want CHIARA I to be seen by the men of the people. Those who still want to return to the Spanish are scared with what Luis Figueroa has done, those evil men want to destroy what our people build. That can not be, nor is it fair, we must ask the Revolutionary Government, so that what our compatriot Luis Figueroa has done, be seen by all the men of the people.

  BUENOS AIRES, July 7. LA CRONICA. - Argentina was plunged into a total standstill at midnight, immediately following the cabinet's resignation. The 48-hour strike, declared by the powerful Confederation of Labor (CGT), began at midnight in an open conflict between workers and the Peronist government, although most of the major unions have already been on strike for a week, protesting against inflationary price policies, which are curtailing wage gains. The Press and Media Secretariat of the Presidency of the Nation issued a statement announcing the resignation with the aim of providing the Head of State with "the political and economic solutions she deems necessary." The strike today and tomorrow will only include those related to medical care, electricity, and running water. The strike call was supported by workers, the press, legislators, and members of the armed forces. Around midnight, traffic was generally congested as everyone rushed to get home. The Buenos Aires press reported that merchants had tripled the price of meat; they also forced people to buy other items.

  A delegation of young people traveled from Lima to Paucartambo. They were going to the first meeting of the Revolutionary Youth. Just as in Lima, young people in other towns
  
  Ten by ten, they also went to the Paucartambo meeting. Among the young people, they will give their speeches and talk about our people. At this meeting, young people will talk about what they have been observing, what they have been hearing, what they have read, what they think. They will say everything without fear, using language that knows no fear. That is very good; the young will learn, on their own initiative, the language of truth, the language that is not forgotten. In Paucartambo, the elders must welcome the young with open arms, with their best hearts, so that the young know how the revolution progresses, and how the old contemplate the young who will no longer suffer.

  Every revolution, when it's true, must find enemies. The wealthy hate revolutions. If revolutions weren't hated, they wouldn't be revolutions. Revolution is the most difficult task; revolutions aren't built solely with words. Revolutions are consolidated through the work of men, with their real sweat. But it's not just the bourgeoisie who wants to destroy the revolution; there are misguided men, those who see everything in dreams; these men want to take the Peruvian Revolution down other paths. Thinking about these things, women, speaking only among themselves, meeting together, have formed an organization to walk alongside the Revolution. In the Year of the Woman, women cannot watch the revolution from afar, they have said. That is what women must do in all villages, in meetings held among themselves, choosing each other.
  
  talking among themselves, they must stand up, organize themselves to walk together with the revolution.

  Engineer Mario Samamé Bogio, Executive Director of the National Council of Peruvian Universities, stated yesterday that the university has failed to provide an adequate, timely, and effective response to the political and social revolution that is attracting the attention of all the peoples of the world, and for which the Armed Forces are the main beneficiary. He made this statement in the thoughtful speech he gave during the opening ceremony of the Seminar-Workshop on Educational Technology, organized by CONUP and attended by professors from 33 universities in the country. Engineer Samamé stated that over the past four decades, the Peruvian university, through its most distinguished representatives, has questioned the existing social order. He noted that revolutionary approaches to land ownership, the form of social property, and the struggle against all forms of imperialism have been put forward in the classrooms.

  Prime Minister and Minister of War, Major General Francisco Morales Bermúdez, announced yesterday that talks with the people will resume in August in the provinces, when he makes his planned visit to the southern departments, which, for reasons of national interest, simply had to be postponed for a few weeks. Regarding the pilgrimage held last Wednesday to the Presbitero Maestro Cemetery by members of the Peruvian Armed Forces and Auxiliary Forces to pay posthumous tribute to the officers and soldiers who fell in the 1932 APRA uprising, he said it was a very simple matter, that is, a very brief ceremony held identically every year. After reaffirming that the aforementioned ceremony was strictly military, Morales Bermúdez stated that the Government harbors no hatred toward anyone. "No man in the government hates any Peruvian, absolutely. These are simply unpleasant historical events that the military institution remembers, because they are traces left on the institution," he said. Furthermore, the Prime Minister revealed that the Revolutionary Government is preparing important measures that could be unveiled during the celebration of the National Holidays. These statements were made during a brief conversation the Prime Minister held at the conclusion of the ceremony awarding Dr. Pedro Patrón Faura the Grand Cross of the State Civil Service.

  The Revolutionary Government has ordered that no one may sell fish. Only the Government may buy and sell fish, seeking to lower its price so that poor people can afford it. As we know, it is the resellers who raise the price of fish in their desire to make a profit. That business ended with the Revolutionary Government's order. Only the Government will buy the entire catch and then distribute it to small merchants, so they, in turn, can sell it to housewives. As we know, fish is a food that gives great strength, which is why it is priced fairly. The people have received the Revolutionary Government's orders with great joy. Now there will be no shortage of fish on the tables of the poor, nor will it cost too much; all the people of the people will eat fish.
