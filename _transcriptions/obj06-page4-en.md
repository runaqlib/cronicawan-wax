  _FROM INDIA_
  
  NEW DELHI, INDIA, July 1975 (for CRONICAWAN). — New Delhi is the capital of India (India, a country located on the Asian continent, has an area of ​​3,268,000 square kilometers and 550 million inhabitants). In this country, the rulers have declared the suspension of "guarantees," meaning that citizens can be arrested without a prior court order. This measure has been taken in view of seditious attempts against the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, taking advantage of the fact that the Indian Parliament is questioning her permanence as such. This escalation is being fostered by right-wing and reactionary elements who want to keep India in misery. During Indira Gandhi's government, legislation has been passed in favor of the poor majority, which is why they want to overthrow this ruling group.

  KAMPALA, July (For CRONICAWAN). - Ugandan President General Idi Amin Dada today pardoned writer Dennis Hill. Writer Dennis Hill had described the Ugandan President as a "village titan" in a book he wrote. He was sentenced to death for it. Idi Amin Dada initially requested, as a condition for reversing the death sentence, that Queen Elizabeth II of England intercede on behalf of the writer, and that the clemency petition be personally presented to him by Minister James Callaghan. While visiting Zaire, President Amin Dada granted the pardon through the mediation of Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, thereby reversing the death sentence against him.

  _PERUVIAN MOTION IS APPROVED_IN MEXICO
  
  MEXICO CITY, July 1975 (FOR CRONICAWAN).- In Mexico City, the Revolutionary Government of Peru scored a major victory at the World Conference for "International Women's Year," which is being held in this capital.
  
  The Peruvian delegation garnered support from its peers attending the event for its presentation demanding greater respect for women in the media. Newspapers, radio, and television should serve the liberation of women. Women should not be seen as objects of pleasure or instruments of profit. The image of women as sex symbols should be banished. Governments are also asked to promote the projection of a dignified image of women by prohibiting their use as sex symbols and fostering a better understanding of women's role in society.

  _IN ARGENTINA THEY PARALYZE THE_FACTORIES.
  
  BUENOS AIRES, July (For CRONICAWAN). The Argentine people are experiencing moments of anguish. The government and the union organizations grouped in the CGT are currently facing off. This confrontation stems from President Maria Estela Martinez de Perón's refusal to approve the labor agreements signed by workers with employers. These agreements were signed due to the rise in the cost of living, which caused a considerable drop in the purchasing power of the currency. The increases achieved through this system exceeded 100 percent, which the Argentine government considered excessive and would place the country on the brink of collapse. Therefore, the government has set a maximum limit of 45%. In response to this government measure, Argentine workers have paralyzed work in production centers, demanding the repeal of this provision and the resignation of the heads of Social Welfare, José López Rega, and of Economy, Celestino Rodrigo. Demanding acceptance of their demands, the CGT has declared a 72-hour general strike. This work stoppage has placed the government of Isabel Martinez de Perón in a difficult situation. The workers are considered the bastion of Peronism, and they have repeatedly demonstrated this. Never since the time of JD Perón has Argentina seen a confrontation of this nature. We cannot predict the outcome of this situation. Meanwhile, the Argentine Armed Forces have declared their support for the national government in its governing duties.

  _TRASH INVADES THEM._
  
  NEW YORK, July 1975. (For CRONICAWAN) - New York City, the largest city in the U.S., has 14 million inhabitants. This city woke up on the 2nd amidst huge piles of garbage, every street flooded with trash. The government is facing a budget deficit, so they have stated that if they cannot secure the necessary loans, around 40,000 workers will have to be laid off. This total includes street sweepers, firefighters, police officers, and administrative employees. In solidarity against these layoffs, strikes have been declared by various labor sectors. With the virtual absence of street sweepers and garbage collectors, the entire city has become a gigantic garbage dump, where rats have made their appearance. Added to this are the high temperatures that have been recorded, which cause rapid decomposition of waste deposited in public streets. This has raised fears.
  
  Justifiably, the residents of New York City are facing the emergence of epidemics with unpredictable consequences. Likewise, the reduction in police force threatens to leave the city unprotected and its citizens at the mercy of thieves and murderers. Likewise, firefighters have stated that with the reduction in firefighting personnel, they will not be able to provide their services to the city with the necessary efficiency. Added to this are the massive traffic jams and traffic jams.
