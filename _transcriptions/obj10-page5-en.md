  _THE REVOLUTION AND THE PEASANTS_
  
  In an act that took on truly symbolic dimensions, the farm workers were the first to take possession of one of the major newspapers expropriated by the Revolution. The newspaper "El Comercio." The symbolism lies in the fact that in this country—historically, peasants—were the most neglected. The humiliated and offended, to use the old and expressive phrase of the great Russian novelist Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky. They were the last, and now they are beginning to be the first, as the immortal Rabbi of Galilee taught us. The times, then, are being fulfilled. Inexorably. Definitively and instructively. Still, within this Revolution and, above all, on its periphery, there are those, wearing the old Pharisee's tunic, who proclaim themselves more deistic than God and want to teach us what a revolutionary process can and cannot do; should or should not do. And who, under the pretext of preserving balances, long since shattered, speak of impossible stabilizations at this stage. No, gentlemen. You are very wrong. Revolutions, when they have surpassed a certain limit and are truly These have something like their own internal laws. And no one can turn you into an instrument of their particular desires or private conceptions. Therefore, both the leaders of the Creole oligarchy and the leaders of the APRA party understood perfectly well that they could not and should not take a single step toward national transformation, except in purely formal aspects, lest nothing change, truly, like a certain Italian nobility of the Risorgimento. But the Peruvian Armed Forces did dare to break the taboo; they had the courage to cross forbidden thresholds. They resolved to brave the challenge of the unknown. Because a Revolution (no matter how well planned) is always a challenge to destiny. Making it explode unchecked always has something of a Sorcerer's Apprentice about it.
  
  Everything, however, once the decisive step has been taken, consists of trusting in the popular instinct. And, above all, the instinct of the most and most exploited under the regime that is being replaced. In our case, of the peasants. Especially the mountain peasants. Of those who instituted the ayllu and the ancestral habits of associative property and common labor, which have resisted all aggressions and distortions for centuries. Of those who created the most fabulous Empire of the New World, whose hydraulic works, based on cooperation and the massive employment of labor, seem to have been borrowed by modern China to rebuild its battered country. This Revolution, fortunately, is proving, under the skillful and mature leadership of President Velasco, its capacity to understand this fundamental rule. And thus it was that the first far-reaching social task undertaken since the beginning of the process was constituted by the Agrarian Reform, the reclaiming of land usurped from the peasants. And so it was that this Revolution inscribed as its first and most cherished slogan at the top of its Irontispicio: "Peasant, from today on, the boss will no longer eat from your poverty," according to the immortal phrase of the immortal Tupac Amaru. And so they have followed: the Water Law, which destroyed and reduced to ashes the "acquired rights over the fertilizing life element. The modification of the rules that allowed coastal peasants to be circumvented through fictitious "parcel divisions" carried out by the old and cunning landowners. The transfer of the assets of the once all-powerful National Agrarian Society to the great Agrarian Confederation of Peru, which represents the vast majority of agricultural workers. And, finally, now, the transfer of the country's most important newspapers to the organized sectors of the population. The peasants of Peru have assumed a very great and honorable responsibility by receiving an influential means of mass communication in their hands. As we told you, when speaking with them not long ago in Ancón, you must be aware of this historic responsibility. And, fortunately, that seems to be the case. They in no way intend to turn "El Comercio" into a mere internal bulletin. They can use the radio for that. And, by the way, we insist that they need important and powerful radio stations to broadcast their permanent message to the entire country.
  
  **SECRET CHRONICLE**
  
  _FLAG PASSION THAT IS_WING: YES I SWEAR!
  
  Sprung from eternity to live without pause, flag of my Homeland, twice true: Soaked in the light of heroes, wielded by the blood of the people, Banner of my Homeland, wet with the laughter of children. Symbol of horizons summoning the winds. Dream that rises to live deeper in the blood of man. Common mother, clay that is spark, re-divided lamp, flag that is rainbow, jubilation that is presence stitching the silence of the dead. Fountain of longings, flag of my Homeland: More extensive than time, rising in your name, justice becomes light. In your sonorous trembling, the voices of history once again raise their hymns. Flag of my Homeland, I do not explain your face to speak of your origin. You were announced on all roads before the Conquest was an avalanche of sabers. Your presence in time was germinated passion. Piece of eternity, that seeing us born, filled our lives with possible jugs. Flag of pure fire, clearing paths before man departs. Flag that is the path from life to death, two-tone, beloved, high-flying flag. Flag of my country, once you were a word, a symbol seen from afar, today you are our flesh, that deep substance born in our souls, courage and soul you are, beating beyond all promises, rooted and palpable in the Agrarian Reform, a plume of smoke in all the factories and their new justice, a sword of peace against war, a word without gag in the newspapers that were silent until yesterday. Flag of my country, you are the courage that the history of the silent people awaited, the accumulated light, you are the origin of all feats. I swear by what you were, by our people I swear. I swear by you, flag, by the hands that rescued me from prison, because you decreed the joy of the Indian, you closed prisons to inaugurate swallows. Flag of my Homeland, substance that gives life even in death, sentinel of time, drawing your name I will discover the secret that makes the seas great, infinity extensive, immortal to yourself. I swear by you, flag, by my people, neglected, beaten, sold, I swear by all Peruvians that you rescued them from the root of tears. And I swear, by the hands that hold you, by the forehead that reaches you in its humility. Ari: Qananmi kasaq: Llatanchisrayku, unanchayninchis rayku, revolusionninchis rayku.

  _MILITARY PARADE_
  
  The martial Military Parade, which millions of Peruvians witnessed yesterday, in person or on television, had the merit of demonstrating a disciplined, efficient, and at the same time equipped Armed Forces for peace, deserving of general applause. The President of the Republic, Major General Juan Velasco Alvarado, presided over the ceremony from the podium, accompanied by his government team and representatives from both Peru and abroad. The Head of State, both upon his arrival and upon his departure following the magnificent parade, received warm applause, followed by thousands of Peruvians who strove to see him up close and shake his hand. We believe this is an opportune occasion for the Peruvian people to once again understand the support they have in an Armed Force not only for the protection of national borders and for the maintenance of order and peace, but also that the Peruvian soldier of today, at the various levels of the military hierarchies, is fully capable of intervening decisively in the great process of structural changes that have taken place in our country since October 3, 1968. The Peruvian people, highly intuitive, know how to perfectly understand this new and revolutionary role of the Armed Forces in Public Administration, not to increase unproductive and sterile bureaucracy, but to energize the progress of the State and project it promptly and in its proper direction to every corner of the country. Surely this has been one of the main reasons why so many thousands of Peruvians—men, women, and children—from the early hours of the morning of the 29th, lined the entire length of Avenida Brasil with the justified desire to witness a martial parade with a profound revolutionary content.
