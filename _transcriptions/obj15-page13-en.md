  **NO SEPARATIONS**
  
  
  
  As in a senseless competition, days follow nights, swift and urgent, without listening to the trill of the winds, they go separately, without pausing at any wound, without seeing any heart; they go quietly, without a stay... Day never waits for night, they never pause together to mutter over their footsteps; they are never in the same joy, nor do they weep together over the same anguish. In the same struggle, we men and women compete, we separate the nonexistent, dividing the same path. Why? We ask ourselves; like a cloud of turbidity, it carries the same uncertainty, it answers us...
  
  
  
  For the cause of man, man and woman must not be separated; we cannot walk on different paths like day and night. We are one. It is possible to separate the footprints from the road, the river from its bed, the red conception from the blood; no. Likewise, in the cause of man, man and woman must struggle on the same path, with the same spirit, with the same footprint... TO RA

  **WOMAN'S WORD**
  
  
  
  In cemeteries, where all ambitions become unfading dreams, grazing the public squares where the nursery plots unexpected spells, children with dull eyes perform the most esoteric and unexpected jobs. It is childhood without infancy, the age of toys crumpled by the indolent hand of a society where bourgeois personalism is the face and seal of all measures. Children wear improbable outfits, walk, run, and/or jump, driven by poverty. They are premature still lifes of sadness pouring out their loneliness with full hands. The juvenile codes and all the laws boil in each of their letters, perfectly sealed in the books. They are noble dreams without roots and in reality. It is still necessary for justice to reach all children, not as an act of compassion but as a right that assists them. When childhood is full, vital, full of light, the Revolution will have the capital "R" of its first letter perfectly rooted in the future, as Marti said: "The child is the father of the man."

  **REMEMBERING THE WOMAN**
  
  
  
  The figures of Micaela Bastidas, María Parado de Bellido, and Juana Alarco de Danmert, as well as the symbol representing International Women's Year, which features a dove (a symbol of peace) and the sign of representing the female sex, began circulating as postage stamps a week ago. Three Peruvian women worthy of exemplifying the actions of women in our country have been chosen. Micaela Bastidas was the woman who felt the quest for freedom in the deepest roots of her soul. She possessed the power and strength that inspires hope for Peru's freedom. She was the wife and confidant of José Gabriel during his childhood.
  
  
  
  Condorcanqu Tupaq Amaru was a brave soldier who fought clandestinely, giving orders, safe-conducts, commissions, and appointments as chief justice. She was also an admirable mother and wife, who knew how to raise an exemplary family alongside her husband. Exposed to all the cruelty of her enemies, enemies of the patriots, she died quartered next to her husband in 1780. María Parado de Bellido was a woman of admirable patriotism, a fruitful example of heroism. She was the one who warned the patriots of the movements of the royalists during the stage of emancipation. They urged her to denounce the patriots, but she never denounced her comrades. She died in Ayacucho in Juana Alarco de Danmert, in the difficult days of the war with Chile, she was the one who founded the Auxiliary Society to care for the wounded in hospitals and for prisoners. She traced the paths of an authentic and systematic help to society and, this is how the Social Service is defined. She also provided invaluable assistance support to the
