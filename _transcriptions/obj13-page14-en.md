  tion to this quote, which if we looked only at his physical presence, would tell us little or nothing. Perhaps only her slanted eyes would catch our attention, otherwise, thin, short, they do not make us imagine the prototypes of the heroine. But it is she, the brave Nguyen ThBinh, Chancellor of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. A forty-year-old woman in the heat of the liberation struggles of the heroic Vietnamese people, she has been characterized as a
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  brilliant organizer and leader of the Vietnam Liberation Front and the Women's Liberation Union. Nothing made her retreat in the fight for the liberation of her homeland, not the loss of her family—her parents, siblings, and children perished in the criminal Yankee bombings—nor four years in prison that vainly tried to extinguish her fiery love for her country. Just like her, thousands of women sacrificed their lives in the fight against the Yankee aggressor, but finally the Vietnamese people triumphed in
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  their struggle, and today, in Vietnam, the country is being rebuilt with the determined and decisive contribution of all its children, men and women, without distinction of sex, because the struggle has made them equal.

  **(WOMAN'S VOICE)**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The No-al quote has served to demonstrate – once again – the preponderant role of women in leading the peoples of the Third World. THE SOLE PRESENCE OF NGUYEN THI BINH, REPRESENTS
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  TE OF THE PEOPLE OF VIETNAM, THEIR LUCIDUOUS INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR GLORIOUS CAREER RATIFY THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN IN THE STRUGGLES FOR THE LIBERATION OF THEIR PEOPLES. There are still ladies in our midst who believe they belong to superior or pure races. For them, the absurd social pyramid of the ColoMES DE Agosto still exists, IN ALL THE FIELDS OF AGRICULTURAL PERU THE WOMEN, TOGETHER WITH THEIR HUSBANDS, PREPARE THE LAND TO PROCEED WITH THE SOWING.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The work of the Scout girls was moving, directing traffic, with serenity and poise. THE PERUVIAN PROPOSAL ON WOMEN WAS INCLUDED IN THE LIMA DOCUMENT. ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR CO NAMUP AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL The hour of love exists as the obligation of combat for men and women. MORE FIRM AND UNITED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE PERUVIAN REVOLUTION. THE RIVER IS NOT STOPPED OR THE CAUSE OF THE PEOPLE IS STATIZED.
