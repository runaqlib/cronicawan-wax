  _MINER PERU LLAQTANCHISPA SAYWAN_
  
  **Miner PERU, PILLAR OF OUR PEOPLE.**
  
  The peoples of the world are divided. They are divided into two groups.
  
  Some are rich countries; those countries are few.
  
  Others are poor countries. There are quite a few of those countries.
  
  Our country is in the group of those poor countries.
  
  Rich countries, because they have a lot of money, build factories and machinery. Poor countries, because they don't have money, can't build those factories or machinery.
  
  For rich countries to operate their factories and build their machinery, they need "raw materials." These raw materials are found in poor countries like ours.
  
  Rich countries, for little money, without paying the fair price, take these raw materials from poor countries. In their factories, they turn them into all kinds of objects. These objects, made in their factories, are then sent to poor countries so that we can buy them at high prices.
  
  To have more money, those rich countries put their money into poor countries, so in the mines, for having put a little money, they take away our wealth for almost nothing.
  
  The wealthy in those countries join together, pool their money, and form a company to exploit poor countries. These are called transnational corporations. These transnational corporations further impoverish our people.
  
  In our country, in Peru, these transnational companies controlled almost all the mines. They only operated a few mines; they didn't operate the other mines; they waited for the other mines to be finished.
  
  All the mines were in the hands of foreigners, and only three were working: Toquepala, Marcona and Cerro de Pasco.
  
  The other mines were separate, guarded. Because they were guarded. They were in "reserve," because other mines they had in other countries were working.
  
  They were only concerned with making huge profits, nothing more. They didn't care about what our country wanted: for those mines to be worked to provide jobs for Peruvians, for our wealth to be exploited so we could build our own factories.
  
  All of this used to happen in our country. Previous governments used to enter into deals with these transnational companies.
  
  But now, that has ended in our country. That will no longer happen. On April 4, 1970, the Revolutionary Government enacted Decree Law No. 18225, the Mining Industry Regulatory Law. This law established a one-year period for all mining concessions held in reserve to be put into operation. If, by the end of this period, the corresponding work had not begun, all mines in that state would return to state control.
  
  This same law established the creation of MINERO PERU, a state-owned company responsible for bringing into operation all mines that had reverted to the state. It is also responsible for prospecting, prospecting, and developing new mines.
  
  MINERO PERU is the effort of our Peru to truly own our wealth. What is ours must be worked for. Only then will our country be rich and free, breaking the bonds that held us, and the other countries of the world will respect us.
  
  In our Peru, there are all kinds of minerals. We have copper, silver; gold; lead, zinc, antimony; arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, tin, indium, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, selenium, thallium, tellurium, tungsten, all kinds of mines.
  
  The most unique mines are: Toquepala, Marcona, Cerro de sao Cerro Vende, Santa Rosa, Quellaveco, Michiquillay, Morococha, Cuajone.
  
  Since MINERO PERU was created, these are the mines it has been working on:
  
  1.-GREEN HILL
  
  Located in Arequipa, it is being invested 36 billion soles. It will produce copper starting in 1976. This is one of the richest mines. 3,000 people will work there.
  
  2.-MICHIQUILLAY.
  
  This mine is located in Cajamarca, it will start producing in January 1980. 22.5 billion soles are being invested in this mine. This mine will also produce copper and will provide work for 3,000 people.
  
  3.—TINTAYA.
  
  This mine is located in Cusco. 3.7 billion soles will be invested there. Copper will also be extracted here, starting in December 1978. It will provide work for 1,000 people.
  
  4.-QUELLAVECO.
  
  It is located in Moquegua. Production will begin in December 1980. An investment of 9 billion soles will be made here. This mine will also produce copper. It will employ 1,800 people.
  
  5. -ANTAMINE.
  
  Located in the Department of Ancash, production will begin in December 1979. An investment of 4 billion soles will be made there. It will produce copper and employ 3,000 people.
  
  6. - SAN ANTONIO DE POTO.
  
  This mine, located in the Department of Puno, will produce gold starting this year. A total of 600 million soles has been invested there, and 300 people will be employed.
  
  7.— STOP CHICAMA.
  
  This mine, located in the Department of La Libertad, will produce coal starting in December 1979. A total of 5.75 billion soles will be invested there, and it will provide work for 1,500 people.
  
  8.—OYOYYN.
  
  Located in the Department of Lima, this mine will also produce coal. It will require an investment of 1.3 billion soles and employ 1,500 people.
  
  There are also other mines that are just beginning to be developed. These mines are: Santa Rosa, Ferrobamba, Calicobamba, Berenguela, El Chorro, and Coracchuayco.
  
  BAYOVAR
  
  MINERO PERU hasn't stopped working in the mines. It's building a factory called Bayovar.
  
  
  
  
  
  Here what we know as fertilizers will be manufactured.
  
  This huge factory is being built in the Department of Piura, because as you know, these fertilizers are like guano and serve to improve soil production.
  
  This factory is already producing 50 thousand metric tons of fertilizers known as Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, etc.
  
  1,000 people are working there.
  
  
  
  
  
  MARCONA.
  
  We'll add more. The Marcona mines are still in the hands of a transnational company, while in our hands, MINERO PERU controls what they produce and how much this mine produces.
  
  This is MINERO PERU, it works for our country and represents a pillar of support for our country.
  
  There is a man, a General, who, with his efforts, with the sweat of his brow, with the emotion that springs from his heart, is making MINERO PERU shine. We must not forget his name: General Jorge Fernández Maldonado, Minister of Energy and Mines.
