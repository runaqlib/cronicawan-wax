  **OLD WOMAN STILL MAKES THE PIANO CRY**
  
  
  
  A 101-year-old grandmother still makes her piano weep. This old lady's name is Julia Alonso del Castillo. On Thursday in Mexico City, she reminisced about her younger years and brought joy to the hearts of all who listened. "How lovely!" the people who listened said. "I hope she lives another 100 years."

  **Cripples boo**
  
  
  
  From a school in Tokyo, a man and three girls, all disabled, swam all day. They crossed the sea, disabled, in a constant state of chaos. They're still very young, only 15 and 17 years old. What a big fuss they would make if they were healthy, truly, there are things that are unbelievable.

  **THE WITCHES WILL MEET**
  
  
  
  At the end of this month, the witch doctors will meet in the city of Bogotá. For this very reason, they are receiving all sorts of accusations. Initially, the priests opposed it because it's dangerous for the villagers. It's not for the best if the witch doctors meet, if they go to the village with their dogs and leopards. Witch doctors don't meet for the best...

  **THE COSMOS ASK ABOUT THE SPANISH PEOPLE**
  
  
  
  They say that what we call a UFO landed in the town of Laredo. It's the plane of those who live in the sky. They say they saw it in the town we're talking about, flashing red and green, circling in circles. They didn't just ask about the Spanish town, but how many times have they come to our town and we haven't seen them?
