  The chief said to Burila with gravity: "Daughter, when will I meet the chosen prince, to teach him our sacred formulas and the treasure cave?" I am dying every day.. -Lord, do not speak like that because you make me sad, -This is how we speak, girl, those of us who were young and must hand over power. Prince Tota was camping with his honor guard, witches and captains, to the west of the village. Opia, the other suitor, accompanied by his master and a servant, arrived without a spear. Tota held military parades and tournaments in honor of the princess. Opia sent her birds of seven colors and fair bills. She was kind to both, but she did not make up her mind. The one, angry, conceived many plans of conquest. The other found the wait beautiful.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  One morning, when Opia, in the middle of the stream, was looking for red sardines for Burila, who on the shore was looking at him affectionately, Tota arrived and, full of jealousy, holed up the blowgun. The dart pierced Opia's neck, who fell gently into the waters and died with a tender smile for her beloved. She screamed in rage and Tota fled in terror. Bulira cried without consolation and without rest on the river. She shed tears until she lost her eyes, which became two large golden oyster pearls. Since then, the Opia River in Tolima was filled with oysters, which are tears of Bulira, the blind lover.

  When tenderness comes to Vietnam Vietnam And no more pain rains On the earth Then it will be a dream Realized See the great intruder Defeated Oh Vietnam is there Vile harassed By the enemy Damned Exploiter Thank you very much It is that you have great courage That you give to beings Without asking for their hearts If a thousand voices joined together With mine For Vietnam I would sing.
