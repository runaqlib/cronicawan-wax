  **### Ideological foundations of the Peruvian revolution**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Peruvian Revolution is an autonomous process that is developing to transform the political, economic and social system of the De and cancel our condition of underdeveloped, capitalist, oligarchic society subjected to the interests of imperialism, in order to build a social democracy in which all Peruvians can realize themselves through full participation in the exercise of social power within a truly sovereign national community.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Peruvian Revolution defines itself as Nationalist and Independent and is doctrinally based on a Revolutionary Humanism that is clearly opposed to systems of social exploitation and to dogmatic and totalitarian systems. Therefore, it rejects the capitalist and communist systems.

  —He staunchly defends the nation's resources; and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — Ensures the right of Peruvians to “develop their own ideological and political concepts, cultural expressions and institutional forms arising from the historical tradition and creative spirit of our people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  2.-FOR BEING INDEPENDENT.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — It affirms its full conceptual and political autonomy and therefore rejects any attempt at foreign interference;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — It takes a militant stance against any form of external domination or political, economic or military dependence on any international centre of power;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — It directs its actions towards achieving integration and autonomous regional development in Latin America.

  As a nationalist and independent country, the Peruvian Revolution maintains an unwavering anti-imperialist position. Consequently, it supports the People's Record against all forms of imperialism, colonialism and international subordination.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  3.- REVOLUTIONARY HUMANISM.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — Considers man as an end and not as a means, recognizing him as the social maker of history;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —It postulates the full realization of the human person, conceiving freedom and justice as inseparable values and rejecting all forms of exploitation;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —It aims to build true human coexistence based on solidarity;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — It promotes the liberation of man from all forms of domination and therefore rejects the existence of any oligarchy:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — Advocates a morality for action based on the correspondence between means and ends: and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — Recognizes tolerance as a value and, therefore, rejects dogmatism by denying violence as a system.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Revolutionary Humanism brings together important strands of social thought that have emerged from the universal historical tradition to which Peru belongs. This legacy is essentially expressed in socialist thought, libertarian thought and Christian thought. In them, the Peruvian Revolution finds a fundamental source of inspiration for its transformative action.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1. Revolutionary Humanism draws on the legacy of non-dogmatic and non-totalitarian socialist thought by:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —To postulate that work is the original source of wealth;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — Propose that, within a pluralist economy, the means of production should be primarily socially owned;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —Promote the role of state ownership for the benefit of the entire national community, within the new conception of the Participatory State, and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —Aspire to an order in which socially generated goods benefit their producers and the entire society.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1. Revolutionary Humanism embraces the heritage of libertarian thought by:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —To postulate within a supportive society, as an inviolable right, the essential freedom of the human being from all forms of arbitrariness and imposition;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —To advocate that power and decisions arise with the least possible mediation, from the social base in accordance with the interests of the entire nation; and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — Promote the creative sense of individuals and groups by affirming their autonomy and social responsibility to make their own decisions.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1. Revolutionary Humanism is inspired by Christian thought by:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —Uphold the essential equality of all men, the foundation of human fraternity, and reject, consequently, all forms of social and economic injustice,
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —To highlight the value of solidarity and propose the elimination of the causes that have historically created inequality, hatred and struggle among Peruvians;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —To affirm that only by building a just society can men have true freedom and fully develop their personality in all its dimensions;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —To aspire to the construction of an authentic human coexistence to achieve a society without exploiters or exploited, the only real basis of union between all Peruvians; and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - Recognize that the family constitutes the foundation of society and is a school of the richest humanism.
  
  
  
  1. The essence of these revolutionary traditions is expressed in the fundamental participatory character of the Peruvian Revolution which:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —It proposes the opening of broad and multiple channels that give all Peruvians access to decisions at the various levels and fields of social activity:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —He affirms that the existence of institutions based on the democratic intervention of their members is an essential condition for the full development of individuals and social groups:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —Promotes the use of authentically democratic methods in achieving its political, social and economic objectives;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —It advocates a new conception of the structure of the State based on the elimination of centralism and bureaucratization;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —It advocates organized access for workers to management, ownership and profits of companies.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — It favors the progressive transfer of economic and political power for its social exercise by autonomous institutions of Peruvian workers and, therefore, rejects its manipulative concentration;
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  —It defends the autonomy of social organizations against any attempt at external control and, consequently, rejects the political institutionalization of the Revolution in the form of a party.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  e: Obeying the meaning of these traditions, the Peruvian Revolution assumes a fundamental pluralist character by virtue of which.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  - It recognizes the right of all Peruvians to disagree and criticize and, consequently, to organize themselves politically with complete freedom to support different positions. Therefore, it admits the legitimacy of the existence of groups and parties that express diverse political alternatives. Faced with them, the Peruvian Revolution poses its own coherent and homogeneous position, not accepting within its ranks any approaches that contradict or distort its ideological and political foundations; and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  — In the economic field, it supports various forms of ownership and organization of companies, within a dynamic and flexible concept, recognizing: a priority sector of social ownership in which ownership belongs to all workers of the companies in the sector; a state sector in which the State assumes control of basic activities for the development and benefit of the community; a reformed private sector leading to co-management and an exclusively private ownership sector made up of small-scale activities in commerce, artisanal industry and services.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  4.- Based on these ideological bases, the Peruvian Revolution sets as its final objective the construction of a SOCIAL DEMOCRACY OF FULL PARTICIPATION whose essential elements are:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1. A participatory political system based on popular bases;
  
  
  
  2. A pluralistic economic system based on a priority sector of social ownership; and
  
  
  
  3. A social system based on a set of behaviors and moral values that emphasize justice, freedom, work, participation, solidarity, creativity, honesty and respect for the dignity of the human person.
