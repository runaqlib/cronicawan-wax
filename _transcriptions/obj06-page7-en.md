  Cusco, June 28, 1975.
  
  Gentlemen, CRONICAWAN. Lima. Dear Sirs: As the College of Sciences and Arts celebrates its SESQUICENTENNIAL, I offer my most gracious greetings, for having absorbed its wise teachings. My beloved College of Sciences and Arts, your name is a symbol of wisdom and sublime virtues, your name symbolizes constant improvement; through you I strive to expand my knowledge with the language of the Incas, with our beautiful runasimi. We scientists are scattered throughout Peru, working for its greatness. COLLEGE OF SCIENCES AND ARTS When I remember your name, I wipe away my tears of emotion; when I remember your wise teachings, I glorify your name. Your great Hamawt'as come to mind; they are: José Gabriel Cosío, Fortunato Herrera, Eusebio Corazao, Antonio Lorena, Uriel Garcia, Humberto Luna, and others. They are select spirits that bring prestige and glorification to our Cuzco. To speak of Cuzco is to speak of the ever-tender tradition of the College of Sciences and Arts, which is deeply rooted, full of space and sunshine, in the hearts of Cuzco residents. From its bosom came men endowed with honesty, wisdom, honor, and dignity, whose great leadership works and fights for the greatness of the nation. All of us scientists will be at the celebration of your glorious anniversary. My greetings go out to all of them, especially to those who work within it, so that they may see and acknowledge our eternal gratitude. And I extend this invocation to all of us scientists throughout Peru. GLORIOUS COLLEGE OF SCIENCES AND ARTS! This is my voice of profound gratitude that comes from my heart, so that you may receive it on your DAY.

  **ON THE OFFICIALIZATION OF THE**QUECHUA**
  
  _RUNASIMI KUSHKA_CHAKUSQANMANTA
  
  The JOSE ANTONIO ENCINAS INSTITUTE expresses its satisfaction and congratulates the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces for having issued the Decree Law that recognizes "Quechua, like Spanish, as the official language of the Republic." In relation to this transcendental fact, and in order to contribute to the interpretation of our reality and the development of its culture, it considers it a patriotic duty to express: 1. Peru is a multicultural country in which human groups coexist who speak, some Spanish, others, Quechua and not a few Amara, in addition, in the wide Amazon basin, dozens of native languages ​​​​correspond to different tribes. 2. In accordance with the previous premise, the idiomatic personality of the aforementioned human groups must be considered if we truly aspire to respect the spiritual genius of the native cultures, among which Aymara occupies an important place due to the demographic volume that speaks it. 3. That efforts be made to review the alphabets that have been used at the initiative of individuals and entities, so that this instrument is as similar as possible to the Castilian alphabet, in order to avoid complications and confusion in the learning and use of native languages, since most of these alphabets do not meet this requirement. 4. That, when planning relevant actions, the participation of people of recognized cultural level whose mother tongue is one of the native languages ​​be taken into account, preferably, and that the concept of linguists and philologists who do not master these languages ​​not necessarily prevail, because, despite their respectable scientific information, they are at a clear disadvantage.
