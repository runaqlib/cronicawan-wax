  _THE PERUVIAN WOMAN_HE ALSO WEARS A MILITARY UNIFORM
  
  As further demonstration that Peruvian women are assuming their leading role in the creation of a new PERU, for the first time in the history of military parades held during the Fiestas Patrias (National Holidays), they marched alongside their comrades in arms. On the 29th of this month, with a gallant and martial gait, confirming that these qualities are not exclusively the preserve of men, the female members of Armed Forces Units marched along the 35 streets that make up Avenida Brasil in Lima. This occurred not only in Lima but also in the city of Cusco, where female military personnel were present at the Fiestas Patrias parade. Their discipline and martial spirit drew applause from the Cusco public. This demonstration of integration and solidarity between men and women, between Peruvians, between brothers reminds us once again that as such: in today's Peru, we have, therefore, the imperative duty to continue fighting with all our energies and with the best of our wills in whatever our activities, for the strengthening of our national sovereignty, for the defense of its natural sources of wealth and so that we can reach better levels of culture and life, that is to say, to fight together for the well-being that every human being requires for their fulfillment, always alerting all those internal and external forces that only seek our submission. That is why the young women who marched for the first time in the grand military parade held for our national anniversaries reminded us through their escorts: "The responsibility that falls upon each and every one of us in the creation of a new, stronger and more united PERU." The public in our capital was filled with surprise, admiration, and pride, which they conveyed through applause and expressions of praise upon seeing the martial stride of the young women from the Navy, Air Force, and Army. The first female contingent to appear marching along Avenida Brasil were women workers from Navy facilities. A total of ninety of them marched in jackets, skirts, berets, black shoes, white blouses, and white gloves.
  
  AVIATION
  
  They were preceded by the air force, who appeared with their comrades in arms. Assigned to command positions carrying machine guns, one hundred young members of the Women's Air Force Military Service paraded 35 blocks. Their escort consisted of a comrade in arms bearing our bicolor emblem, and two gallant young women with identical figures and faces (they are twin sisters), guarding the National Standard. The audience gave them prolonged applause. These one hundred young members of the auxiliary forces of the Peruvian Air Force had already paraded before an audience on July 23rd at the Las Palmas Officers' School, the day on which our Air Force Week is commemorated.
  
  ARMY
  
  Finally, 180 women who formed the second and third companies of the Army's Airborne Division were present at the parade. They are part of a contingent of 640 future female reserve paratroopers of the Army's Airborne Division. With their excellent physical condition, calm and alert minds, quick reactions, and lack of fear, they were, on the contrary, filled with a great spirit of courage. They were in position from dawn, alongside battalions of troops and officers from the Navy and Air Force.
  
  These young women, who volunteered for the Army's paratrooper corps just over three weeks ago, have already undergone intensive daily training from Monday to Sunday in the fields and technical centers of the Paratrooper School. They have already become an example of the strength and martial spirit of which Peruvian women are capable. During their martial procession in the parade on the 29th, they wore the paratrooper uniform, each carrying a dagger in their right calf, hand grenades in their belts, and a machine gun. The escort of these two companies that marched within the Airborne Division contingent stood out for their great military bearing and stood over 1.75 meters tall. Upon arriving at the official platform, they saluted President Velasco, senior officers of our Navy and the Diplomatic Corps, as well as the general public. To all this, the reactions reflected on the faces of our president, as well as his wife, Consuelo, were ones of enthusiastic pride. They smiled and constantly applauded the young women of the three branches of the armed forces. Mrs. Consuelo de Velasco, with her natural cordiality, had nothing but words of admiration and encouragement for Peruvian women as she watched the female contingents of our Armed Forces march past. This event marks a new milestone in the revaluation of the women of our land.

  _WE WON IN A FOOTBALL MATCH._
  
  In a remote, highland town of Oruro, with no more than 50,000 inhabitants and at an altitude of over 3,000 meters, last Sunday the Peruvian national soccer team secured its first-ever win over Bolivia at home, providing a Fiestas Patrias gift to all Peruvian fans. The 1-0 victory, with the contribution of the ineffable striker Osvaldo Ramírez, is in fact a new milestone for our professional soccer team, considering several circumstances at this moment in national soccer. With its victory, Peru has now secured three points, earned as a visitor. Previously, it tied with Chile in the city of Santiago, and now it has just secured its first victory on Bolivian fields in front of 22,000 spectators, who at the end of the match couldn't believe the Peruvian triumph. The myth of altitude fell to the ground in the face of Peru's superior technical display and the well-planned manner in which the first half was played. Although in the second half, the national team had to withstand the Bolivian team's incursions, they nevertheless managed to emerge victorious. What remains for Marcos Calderón's team must be approached with the same seriousness as it has been up to now. We can say this based on recent experience.
