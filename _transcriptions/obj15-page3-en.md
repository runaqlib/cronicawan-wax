  **SPEECH BY GENERAL VARGAS PRIETO**
  
  
  
  The Chief of the Peruvian Army, General Oscan Vargas Prieto, spoke in Moquegua, on the occasion of the 150th Anniversary celebrations of the "Simón Bolivar" School. On that occasion, General Vargas Prieto outlined the objectives sought in this new stage of the Revolution. The Peruvian Revolution is humanist, libertarian, socialist, and Christian, and no one should be deceived; this revolution has its own path. This new stage will not allow deviations, nor does it mean a return to past stages. That must be made clear. The Revolution is a collection of beautiful thoughts and achievements and ongoing dialogue, always framed by respect for the dignity of the human person. In his speech, he recalled the great Marisca Domingo Nieto, whom he said was a great man, a great defender of the freedom of the homeland, and that we must follow in his footsteps. He also referred to the great Amauta José Carlos Mariátegui, whom he said was a great thinker, a great revolutionary, whose thought illuminates the path our people must follow. He bequeathed us the sacred mandate that we must fulfill: "Let's Peruvianize Peru." We must follow those examples to make our Peru a great homeland, a New Peru, a country truly free.

  **NEW DIALOGUE**
  
  
  
  The Revolutionary Government's dialogue with the people will be restarted. This will be done so that our leaders know whether the measures dictated are being properly implemented and whether these measures have the desired effects or not. This has been made known by Prime Minister General Oscar Vargas Prieto, who added that these dialogues seek to establish essential channels of communication that will allow us to understand the needs and aspirations of the people, thereby further deepening the revolution. The New Political Methodology begins to be fulfilled in this way, with open dialogue.
