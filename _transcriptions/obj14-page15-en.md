  **HOW THEY LIVED THE MOCHICAS** Of all the peoples of our country, the Mochicas were the most warriors; They made war the daily work and death a simple task. These men lived divided into two classes; some lived near the temples within the cities; they guarded the gold of the gods; They healed men, and other lives were taken into their hands. The others are the poor men, those who could no longer work, the invalids. Next to them are the workers on the land, the shepherds, the blind.**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It was wealth that has always separated men; we still live in that separation today. For some it was joy, the fun of hunting, gluttony at feasts; For them, work decreased and rest increased. For the others, however, it was the pain, the sweat, the poverty of the festivities, for them the work spread like a desert, and the rest was dwarfed. The Mochicas experienced that luck...

  **DEL PEOPLE CUPISNIQUI**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Nothing lasts forever, nothing is done forever the day passes quickly and the wind plays swiftly with the corn flowers. It does not rain forever, the sun shines only until night comes. Everything is like that in time, it was also like that in the past. When the splendor of Chavin began to fade, when its nature was already reaching its end, its opulence impoverished. The temples they built began to collapse, their angry gods got lost in the shadows. With the death of this town another town began to be born. The cradle of these people is in the Moche valley, as yesterday their greenery still plays before our eyes, as yesterday the shrines they built, with silent adobes, tell us of their strength, their anguish, their combats. There the huacas of the Sun and the Moon are monitoring the time. They also had gods, but they were not like those of Chavin, they were more human. The priests did not exploit the men, together with them they got involved in their town, together with the peasants they found death. This is for scholars the clearest characteristic. Those residents of the current Trujillo valley are known by the name "Cupisniqui."

  **THE HANDS OF THE MOCHICAS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  What the hands of the Mochicas sculpted has reached us, nothing was difficult for their
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  hands, so that we know about them carved in time. His knowing hands modeled the faces of the people, their smiles, their sorrows, their fiery glances, their pains, their feverish joys; what they didn't know jwañuyninwanmi huq llaqtheir creative hands. The human soul had no secrets for his hands, through his hands the heart still flowed like clear water; the age, the old age of their elders, the daily aging of the women they loved, everything emerged from their hands like a light. They found the wild soul of clay, they knew of the spirit of clay, that is why they were potters of all things. In his hands the corpses, the memories, were reborn; In his hands the food and the fruits, the trees are still green. Their hands, like heralds, bring us their experiences to reach their spirit, so that our hands also reach their roots. Maybe by plowing through their memories we will reach them.

  Man does not only eat meat out of hunger, and not only to satisfy his stomach, he eats meat to quench his angry outbursts, if it is human flesh he delights in every bite. As an example is enough, the other day in Mexico, a man, Gumersindo Mujica Román had a fight with RobertoAnaya Ramírez whose finger he ate, in a moment of hatred. Now they can no longer live as close friends, their gazes are enemies. What things will not be eaten yet.

  **THEY BECOME INTO A WOMAN**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Doctors from the United States operated on a Peruvian citizen and claim to have operated on him to turn him into a woman. Today she is now female. Asking that her sex change be recognized, she has submitted a request to the First Instance Judge of Lima, at the same time that she makes known her new circumstance, asking that her name be officially changed to Claudia. Reason why she should be recognized as a woman. This is the first time it has happened in Peru. Everything is boring to man, being we want not to be, and, not being. we want to be

  **OF THE STRENGTHS THEY RAISED**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  When all the days are still tender, when all the dawns rise, we know of the hatred, of the blood that is sown, of the war that is seasoned. From day to shadow, our sky is covered with angry clouds. Sometimes only happy news shelters our hearts with their light, the evening in which we offer men our affection is rare, those days rarely dawn; They allow joy to grow very little, we never sow joy. That is why men today are mute and silent, they live in quiet solitude, that is why they hide their hand from men who suffer like him, they do not clearly embrace their flags, they grow in secret, fearful of everything, they always see the enemy in man. It has always been like this, when man's life was still scarce, they invented war, to take from man what he had, to take from man what he sowed with effort, to exhaust his work. War arose because of this on earth. To defend what belonged to them, they built fortresses, since then they defended their work, their land and their crops from enemy hands, from enemy desires; This is how they defended what had always been theirs. That's why they have come to us, cities surrounded by fortresses, their stones tell us that man died, that his blood was shed, from which he became man. It will have to be like this until tomorrow, until man's property disappears.
