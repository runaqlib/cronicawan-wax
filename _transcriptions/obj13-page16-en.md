  **WITCH THINGS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At the universal congress of witches, in Bogotá, the other day, a witch, before the eyes of the people, folded keys and locks, with only the force of his thought, he folded without even touching them. He says he breaks things just by looking at them, to twist them he doesn't need his hands. The same character, last Sunday, showed what he is capable of, he is from the city of Israel and his name is Uri Geller. Whether it is true or not, they say that witches carry something of God in half of their soul and something of the devil in the other half. What witchcraft these are.

  **FIGHTING ROOSERS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The inhabitants of Greece fought the inhabitants of Persia for years. By then, Themistocles commanded the Greek armies. As the days went by, halfway along the road, in a cabin, next to a pasture, he saw a cockfight, he set an example of his courage to the soldiers he commanded so that their hearts would not be cowardly in combat. And when he triumphed over the Persian armies, he brought the roosters to Greece, so that every year they would remember his victory. They say that since then the poor roosters fight at village festivals. It is the Greeks who brought it to Spain, and in turn the Spanish have brought it to us. That's right, everything has a story.

  **EATING SOLVED EGGS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In any case there are competitions, it seems that only the challenge takes root in man's brain. In Spain, the other day, a man devoured sixty-five boiled eggs, thus beating an Englishman who ate only sixty-four. With this victory, he is the one who eats the most boiled eggs in the entire world. There are people in this world who eat until they are sick, and there are also those who have not eaten any... There are still many...
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Hinatan layqakunata makinpi paqarichinku. (This is how* *witches are born from other hands)*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Kanmi runtu phasi mikhuqkuna. Mana mikhuqpas* *kallantaq. (There are those who eat boiled eggs and* *there are also those who do not eat them).*
