  **CORRESPONDENCE**
  
  Mr. Angel Avendaño, Director of CRONICAWAN City.
  
  Sir, my consideration: Although I do not have the honor of knowing you personally, I am an admirer of yours through the pages of "Cronicawan." As a speaker of your mother tongue - Runa Simi - I would like to express my congratulations for the patriotic and nationalist task that you have imposed on yourself in favor of the knowledge and dissemination of the Human Language of our ancestors, the Incas.
  
  After 443 years of mastery and knowledge of phonetic writing among the peoples of the ancient Taantin Suyo Empire, this is the first time that Runa Simi has entered the field of the media as the authentic spokesperson for the Peruvian people. This event is due to the revolutionary action of the Government of the Armed Forces, headed by Major General Juan Velasco Alvarado. If there was ever interest among Catholic Missionaries in translating the teachings of the Christian religion into Runa Simi and other Andean dialects, it was for the sole purpose of catechizing the Indians for greater enjoyment of the country's wealth and to benefit from the free services of the infidels. Hence, the so-called bilingual catechisms of the 16th and 17th centuries were only useful to priests and clergy, and never to illiterate indigenous and mestizo people. Now that the Peruvian government has made Quechua official, by Law No. 21156, of May 27, the Directors and Editors of the Lima newspaper "La Crónica" have begun the civilizing mission of spreading the word to the four corners of the Inca Empire, through the founding of the weekly CRONICAWAN. A person as qualified as you to write in Quechua has participated in this task.
  
  Runa Simi language, all kinds of information that may be useful in awakening the sluggish spirits of our brothers. I am sure that at this moment there are thousands of children and adults who know how to read and write in Spanish, who feel proud of being Peruvian and of possessing a language as rich and sonorous as any other language on earth. I understand how tenacious the struggle was to break down the wall of colonialist tradition on the use of the modern scientific alphabet, that is, the exchange of double letters or signs. triples by linguistic and phonological equivalent, such as cc, chch, tt, pp, ckh, etc. by q, q', ch', t', p', k', as it is written in "Cronicawan". This phonetic writing system corresponds, as the Editors and Writers of Cronicaan understand it, to the linguistic system of a universal character, whose scientific principle is based on the following: "each sound must be represented by a single sign or letter: and each letter or sign must represent a single sound." In this way, there is no difficulty in writing and reading any languages ​​​​in the agraphic world, such as American dialects, mainly South American. With the normal use of this modern system, it will be very easy to transcribe all the voices of our ancestral languages, and, therefore, standardize the domain of Ouechua, Aymara and other languages ​​​​of Peru. However, to carry forward the prestige and benevolence of the Runa Simi or Quechua language, it is convenient to take into account Some recommendations from linguists and grammarians, including the following: a. Every agraphic word or word that has been subjected to Latin or European writing, and that has been disseminated in texts on geography, history, literature, etc., must maintain its initial and traditional use, e.g., the names of towns, cities, places, etc., such as Cusco, or Cuzco, Arequipa, Cajamarca, Jauja, and others. b. Every native word or word that has never been disseminated through printed writing must be submitted to modern writing. c. All hybrid compositions, that is, names or foreign words that have been mixed with native words or words, must be distinguished or differentiated by a simple hyphen, e.g., Cronica van, Dios ninchis, Europa pi, Roma pi, Jerusalenta, etc. In this way, the origin and authenticity of each foreign word is respected, and the insertion or hybridization of the aboriginal language is clearly demonstrated. According to this rule, the word Revolution must maintain its purity in pronunciation and writing, that is, show the true phonation, without altering any letter or sign, e.g., write Revolución van kausasunchis, and not Revolusiunan revolusiunpi.....
  
  d. Avoid as much as possible "kechuizing" words or names from foreign languages, e.g. e, do not write "kampisinukunawan but kunawan peasant": "Maldonaduta" instead of "Maldonadota", etc.
  
  e. Not to overuse some letters of the Latin alphabet to write native words, such as "kawsaymi" instead of "kausaymi", in which a is used instead of u. This error, without a doubt, arises from the improper use of the letter by our friend, EProf. John H. Roe, when titling his Anthropological Journal NAWPA PACHA, when the more correct thing would have been to write: NAUPA PACHA, unless he had discovered that NAWPA is derived from NAWI, eye, and PA, suffix of belonging, so that the 1 would have disappeared by euphonic law. But this seems impossible.
  
  Another linguistic issue we should address is the detrimental use of some vowels, such as -a instead of -e, and -u instead of -g. We say this because weak vowels, such as -ju, are of primitive and infantile formation, as observed in many languages ​​of America and Africa. On the other hand, the use of strong vowels, such as -eo, corresponds to highly evolved languages ​​and to virile peoples, such as the Incas and Kollas in our country. This fact is easy to discover in many words in current use: -cosqo instead of -qusqu; -toray instead of -uray; -perda instead of -pirda; etc. It seems that this is a process of phonemic weakness greatly influenced by the inferiority complex of the Spanish conquerors, because they infantilized the language of the Incas, hence the names Piru, Quichihua, Cuzco, etc.
  
  Hopefully, CRONICA WAN will be able to rehabilitate the nationalist spirit that Amauta Julio C. Tello championed when he declared the future of Peru: "Our family tree has deep, strong roots that once drew from this land the sap that nourished a RACE OF GIANTS; the stem has been cut by the European conquest, but new, strong shoots from the gigantic trunk of nationality, new sprouts, are beginning to appear; and they are growing and will continue to grow, nourished by the same indigenous sap and by the impulse of the new Ideas of the century in which we live" (Lima, December 13, 1924).
  
  I take this opportunity to greet you and shake your hands as a Runa masi, a Llata ​​masi. I'm also including an article on the 50th anniversary of the "Discovery of the Paracas Culture" for CRONICAWAN.
  
  Sincerely, Toribio Mejía Xesspe L E. 2724187
