  Today marks one year since the Revolutionary Government announced that, in accordance with the Peruvian model, it would place national newspapers in the hands of organized sectors. From that day on, the enemies of this Revolution made the entire world believe that it was nothing more than a farce, a lie, a law that deceived the Peruvian people. And today, we receive with immense hearts the news, I know, that "El Comercio" is from now on the newspaper of the peasants, that from today "El Comercio" has been transferred to those who till the land, into their hands. No one can now say that this is a measure intended to deceive the Peruvian people, because its truth stands out as clear as the shining sun. The promise of the Revolutionary Government to hand "El Comercio" over to the peasants has materialized in a historic act. Dr. Héctor Cornejo Chávez, President of the Steering Committee appointed by the Government to prepare for this important stage, was present at the ceremony handing over the newspaper's assets to the Board of Directors of the "El Comercio" Civil Association, represented by its President, Alex Noriega Montero, and conducted by the Senior Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Engineer Benjamín Samanez Concha. In the ceremony that followed, Dr. Cornejo Chávez stated that once again the Government's promises are being fulfilled with precision.
  
  "When Peru shocked the continent and the entire world a year ago with the announcement of the unprecedented system of handing over national circulation newspapers to organized sectors, there were many who received this news with skeptical smiles or laughter of rage, helplessness, and fear; they thought that day would never come," the Director of Commerce stated forcefully. Dr. Cornejo Chávez added that inside and outside the country there were those who believed this government initiative was a farce. "We are seeing the answer now, as the peasants are taking physical possession of the company," he added. "Those surrounding us at this table are not bureaucrats disguised as peasants. They are authentic peasants. They are the ones who till the land. The ones who make the land productive. They are the ones to whom we are handing over this newspaper to begin this second stage," he emphasized. He warned that the task entrusted to him is not simple, but rather arduous and difficult. He said that there will be problems, just as they occurred in the first year of the expropriation of the newspapers. However, we will know how to overcome them. At the same time, he thanked the Committee he chaired, which included doctors Jorge Bolaños Ramirez, Ezio Parodi, and Deifilio Bobbio Alejos, for their valuable collaboration. President Alex Noriega Montero expressed his gratitude for the appointment to such an important position and pledged to fully meet the historic challenge of this moment. He stated that the farmers and workers of El Comercio will work together to make this newspaper the best in the country and the world. He announced that he will disseminate education through its pages to the vast majority of people, using clear and simple language.
