  **OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE MARKETS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Since men ruled in the name of the gods, they carried out all tasks in our territory, helping weavers, clay modelers and those who melted gold and metals with their hands. In the same way, those who worked the land were encouraged so that there would be prosperity in the fruits. With the production of various fruits, exchange also began. At first it was with the nearby towns, and as it grew it spread to distant towns. This explains why the fruits of our land are also found in distant places; The fruits found in the excavations of the tombs are testimony. In this way, the market arose in the heart of the towns, countless fruits arrived at those markets that were intended to be sold throughout the town, that is why fruits from the jungle and the mountains were found. But, it was not just a market for fruits, clothes, animals, herbs, etc. were sold. In the same way the image of the gods was sold to foreign peoples. Here are the roots of our markets, the soul of our people.

  **OF THE WORKERS IN GOLD**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With the division of men, with the consolidation of the power of the church, with the emergence of the State, we find the first great revolution of humanity. And so that things remain this way, the potters, the best weavers, the wisest men came together. The best works of these men were destined for the gods, but the gods demanded much more, making themselves heard through the mouths of the priests, so they began to work first in gold and later in copper and silver. The smelting of gold, silver and copper began in our land more than two thousand years ago. At this time the chalice was made for the gods to drink chicha. Likewise, the walls of the temples began to be plastered with gold so that the gods could live elegantly. Those gods lived with the death of men, they grew with their blood. The entire earth was walked along this path... (w h. de. m.s.)

  **OF IRRIGATIONS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Even in today's times, it is very difficult to work our lands, in past times it was even more difficult. We do not have plains, on the contrary it is scattered with hills, and there are infinite sandy areas that extend charred. Seen this way, in our country there is a lack of farmland. Almost all of our lands must be irrigated; There are few that receive rain. This was also a difficulty for men, (and still is today) there is no water. In summary we can say, our lands are few and the water that irrigates them is little.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Knowing this, the ancient inhabitants, with creative thinking, turned parched hills into fertile land, charred sandbanks. For this they built platforms on the hills with collective work; Since then, in barren and wild lands, sweat flourished, and work became a garland. But it was not just the work of the farm, it was the conversion of wild land into human furrows, which is why irrigation canals were opened so that the river could flow through them. Until now, winning those wild lands for the furrows is our greatest effort; Majes, Elms are testimony: fruits will sprout from their waters.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Kunankamapas qarpaspan runachanchis wachukunata* *(Until today by irrigating we humanize the furrows).*
