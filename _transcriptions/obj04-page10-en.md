  **Agrarian reform moves forward without stopping**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Mana sayaytan land reform puririshan*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  TAWANTINSUYU :
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Before the Spanish arrived in our country, already in our Peru, our ancestors worked the land helping each other.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The product of that work on the land was for all men, poverty was unknown.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The land did not belong to anyone individually. It belonged to all the men who worked it, and they helped each other to make it productive.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  They did the mink'a, also the ayni, and in this way they worked the land, collaborating with each other. The work was joyful, with songs and dances they enlivened the work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  FOREIGNERS ARRIVE
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  When the Spanish arrived, they took over the lands of our ancestors and shared them out. Since then, the men of our town worked for the Spanish, as they ordered.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The joy and happiness of work disappeared.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The work became too heavy; beatings and mistreatment became more frequent instead of dancing.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  And so the mit'a appeared, for the suffering of men.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  TUPAQ AMARU RISES
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The suffering of these men was such that in Cusco, Tupaq Amaru rose up in defense of his brothers and sisters. . .
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He rose up in rebellion and war; with him all the
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Men and women also stood up. The main ones of
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The rebellion, they are called as I recall, Micaela Bastidas
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Phuyuqhawa, Pedro Vilca, Apaza, Tomasa Ttitu Condemayta, Diego Cristóbal Tupaq Amaru, Antonio Oblitas.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In this uprising, in this war, the dead were counted in the thousands.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But this war, this revolution of Túpac Amaru, was defeated by the Spanish.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  And then in the city of Cusco, in the Plaza de Armas, all the leaders were killed, with much suffering.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Some were hanged, others had their eyes gouged out first.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But in order to kill Túpac Amaru, they first tore out his eyes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But to kill Tupaq Amaru, they first gouged out his eyes, cut out his tongue, then laid him out in the plaza and tied his hands and feet to four horses in order to dismember him.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Then they burned his flesh. And when his body was turned to ashes, they scattered it to the wind.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  INDEPENDENCE
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Then came Independence. But the suffering of our people remained the same, it did not change at all. The landowners took over all the land and the peasants worked the land for themselves again.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The sadness remained the same, the heartbreaking suffering did not change. It just continued like that.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This is how we have lived. We have lived this way for a long time.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  During all those years, the peasants raised their voices again and again, demanding Agrarian Reform. And while demanding Agrarian Reform, many of them were killed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Previous Peruvian governments did not want Agrarian Reform.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The rulers were the owners of the lands. The gamonales were in the government.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Therefore, as they were the owners of the wealth, they ruled the entire country, so they also formed what we called Parliament, and they also ruled the Judiciary.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this reason, all laws helped the landowner and crushed the peasant.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Any claim by the men of the town, for justice, was made by the judges who helped the landowner and ruled against the peasant.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The men of the people, because they were poor, never, in the life of our country, governed, only the rich governed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For his work, the peasant did not receive a salary, and was forced to work the lands of the gamonal, to earn a small, tiny plot.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Thus they lived a life that was not a life, crushed, humiliated.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But nothing lasts forever.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  THE REVOLUTION DAWNED
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  On October 3, 1968, General Juan Velasco Alvarado began our Revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  General Juan Velasco Alvarado expelled the bad rulers saying: We cannot continue living as we have until today. So that the poor are no longer poor, so that no one humiliates them, so that the rich do not become richer by exploiting the poor, it is necessary that we make the Revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  And then, on June 24, 1969, Agrarian Reform Law No. 17716 was passed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That day the dream of millions of men came true.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That day, in our country, too, a difficult journey began: On that path, we began to destroy a way of life. On that path, we destroyed a whole period of 400 years of living in misery.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With the beginning of the Agrarian Reform, we also began the liquidation of the inheritance of the encomenderos and the participation of millions of peasants who were marginalized in the economic, political, social and cultural life of Peru also began.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  AGRARIAN REFORM
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Agrarian Reform is carried out in two consecutive periods: In the first, the land is expropriated and awarded to the peasants. Along with the land, the peasants are given machinery and livestock. This is provided for by law.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the second, after the lands have been handed over to the farmers, the formation of what we know as Peasant Associative Enterprises takes place.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  What are these Peasant Associative Enterprises? It is a new way of having land, of possessing land. These enterprises are: The Agricultural Production Cooperatives, which to date already total 363 Cooperatives with 1,797,336 hectares, for 87,926 peasant families.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In addition, 50 Agricultural Societies of Social Interest have been formed, they have 2,250,117 hectares and group 55,058 peasant families.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There are also 137 Peasant Communities, which have 40,011 peasant families, to which 476,428 hectares have been given.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There are also 291 Peasant Groups, to which 617,270 hectares have been distributed, and 19,991 peasant families live within these Peasant Groups.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Land has also been given to 17,733 farmers, for a total of 128,544 hectares.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These awards were made until May 31, 1975. But on June 24, 450,000 hectares will also be given to 17,591 families, throughout Peru, in different places.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  All these land transfers to peasant organizations in Peru add up to a total of almost 10 million hectares.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Land is also distributed to small landowners who manage, that is, work, their land directly, as stipulated by law.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ASSOCIATIVE PEASANT COMPANIES
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  (CAP —SAIS)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These Peasant Associations are being established as pillars of support, and the Peasant Communities are also being established as pillars of support. Small landowners also exist in Peru.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These Associative Companies are those that receive preferential attention in their development, and all facilities are granted to them. (This is what we call priority).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These organizations allow both land and irrigation water to be used appropriately. Likewise, machinery and facilities are available to all farmers for general use.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  As the organization and work are joint, so too the distribution of profits must be for all workers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There are two main types of Associative Companies:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1.- Some are the Agricultural Production Cooperatives (CAP). These cooperatives are indivisible. That means: All the land, all the cattle and animals, all the crops, all the machinery, cannot be shared. They belong to all the workers. Likewise, the services provided by the Cooperative are for everyone.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Cooperative members are all those who work on the land, as provided by law.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1. - The others are the Agricultural Companies of Social Interest (SAIS), here too the land, the livestock, the machinery, everything that exists in the SAIS, cannot be divided. Nothing belongs to one man. Everything belongs to everyone.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These SAIS are made up of all the Rural Communities of the Sector and a Services Cooperative.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Thus, with joy, the Agrarian Reform advances in our country.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But the Agrarian Reform Law would not have been complete if it had not been integrated with the General Water Law. This law eliminated ownership of water.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Agrarian Reform has achieved the following achievements:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  1.— He has eliminated the power of the gamonales.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  2.— The best arable lands have been awarded to the Peasant Associations.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But, without forgetting that there are small and medium-sized owners who manage their lands directly and efficiently.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  3.— Political power has been granted to the peasants, through the emergence of the powerful National Agrarian Confederation.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This is how what the leader of the Peruvian Revolution, General Juan Velasco Alvarado, said on June 24, 1969, is fulfilled: "PEASANT, THE BOSS WILL NO LONGER EAT FROM YOUR POVERTY."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With this message, he freed 6 million peasants 6 years ago.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The liberation of these men is a path of no return.
