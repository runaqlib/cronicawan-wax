  I am pleased to address you to greet you very cordially and through you to pass on my request. I would greatly appreciate it if you would send me a copy of your newspaper edited in Quechua, especially for Tuesday, June 10, as on its pages there are translations from Spanish into Quechua and not only that, there is other information, such as the one from June 7, entirely in Quechua, because the edition of CRONICAWAN edited in Quechua does not reach this part of the country, the only goal I have is to learn Quechua.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Because here in this part of the South of the country that is Tacna, Quechua is not spoken, I am almost sure that many other citizens like me will be eager to learn Quechua now that it is official, thanks to our Revolutionary Government.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I am a humble citizen who works as a street vendor. I hope you will excuse me.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Sincerely :

  Guillermo Thorndike Director of the newspaper La Crónica, .
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Dear Mr.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  First I greet you with all my heart.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We, the poor of Cusco, are truly happy. The farmers, the factory workers, we have all received with great joy the immense gift of General Velasco, who has returned our Runasimi to us.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Perhaps it is the gods who live in heaven who have sent the General to redeem our suffering people; because he is doing very well in firmly cutting off attempts at opposition and at the same time and with the same firmness putting back into place what until now was in chaos.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this reason, we Cuscoans are overjoyed. Today, raising our heads high, we will speak our language at the same height, and no one will humiliate themselves, even if they mock us with the cholo and the Indian.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Through this letter I call upon all the people of Pumamarca, so that with immense joy and putting our strength into action, we make Mother Earth produce generously, so that we can help our Revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Those who, like the Santa Rosa Pro Housing Association, under the name of “revolutionaries”, intend to take away what is ours will not be able to take our lands from us.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  They want to take away the fertile lands of Pata-Paula from us in order to negotiate. But everyone already knows the shrewd thinking of leaders like Juan Vargas.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Dr. Ignacio Tello Campodónico, member of the Supreme Court of Lima, is already aware of this.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Mr. Guillermo, a gentleman born in the fervor of the Revolution, that is all I have to say to you.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With the same faith and the same fervor, I beg you, Mr. Guillermo, to be kind enough to publish my letter in our CRONICAWAN. That is all we ask of you, the threads of the poor peasants. Until another day.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Benigno Ccoscco Pantiyoso
