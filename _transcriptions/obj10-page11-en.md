  The symmetrical levels of the steps stretch on endlessly as the silence shatters under the hammer blows of the men building the remaining section of the Civic Center. Time seems as unattainable as the offices we've been searching for. Our exhaustion dictates, we've already climbed more than four floors, but the office that houses the National Commission for Peruvian Women, no, flashes its initials in front of us: CONAMUP. We ask a worker, who tells us we've made a mistake before beginning to smile. The elevator is something else. It takes us without delay, directly to Martha Falcón de Mantilla, Secretary of CONAMUP. At the time of greetings, we only begin to question ourselves about the questions. There are questions as worn out as a familiar door, commonplaces, indexes that point to nothing. They are sullen questions that become mute from being so often respected. We at CRONICAWAN want something different, questions like ointments that possess that tenderness of deep Peru. Martha Falcón de Mantilla flashes a tiny smile, a silence. She looks at us deeply and with a slight movement invites us into the conference room. The sober elegance of the venue gives us the courage to do the job. Martha Falcón, with a multitude of interviews under her belt, begins the discussion with a polite phrase. The photographer flashes her while we hesitate, shielded by a preamble that neither the interviewee needs, nor we require, but we have to start somewhere.
  
  BETWEEN WONDER AND DISCOVERY
  
  Martha Falcon is silent for a moment, her axes igniting like her silence, as if swimming in a lake of music, her hands anticipate her answer: "I admire Saint Martin de Porres. I look at his human figure, I revere his humility, not only his gifts of holiness, his origins, the humility of his birth, the greatness of his life. His love of nature, his innumerable solitude. I admire the Peruvian, the dark-skinned man who rose to the altars. Saints, too, are often alone, like poets, like seekers of utopias. They say that the son of Juan de Porres from Burgos made a dog, a parakeet, and a mouse eat on a plate." We insist with another question, while memory takes us to the distance of those sweet delights.
  
  Between Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Ignatius of Loyola? Who do you prefer?
  
  I prefer Saint Francis. - Why? - I know he's immensely humble, mature in poverty and holiness. - Saint Ignatius, as you can imagine. - I haven't discovered him yet. He must have been justifiably violent, stubborn, full of certainties and determination. Saint Ignatius is a wonder and a discovery for me. - So be it.
  
  A WOMAN'S FORTUNE IS HER FAITH IN HERSELF
  
  Even in tales of chivalry, when ladies came after the gods, even in the most delirious romantic poems, in the midst of all praise, there always lay, and still lays, a certain skepticism about the "impossibility of knowing women," as Guzmán Alfarache used to assert. But whatever is affirmed, woman is the triumph of the heart over matter, and in these days of gray and extensive indolence, women are the time that surrounds us, not because it is "the year of the woman," but because of the just revaluation and recognition of them for the fullness of their rights in all strata of contemporary society. But let's start from the beginning:
  
  Mrs. Martha, when did the marginalization of women begin in history?
  
  -- I don't know, probably with class society, when men contributed their labor to support their families and win wars. The domination of women by men was born with the first injustice.
  
  How do women feel about marginalization?
  
  --We are all friends, even more so since the President of the Republic's call, but women, to a greater or lesser extent, are discriminated against. There are still people who believe women are incapable of many occupations and many other professions. The world is changing, but the ashes of other times linger. (See appendix 1)
  
  But it's fair to recognize that our era is one of transition. The patriarchal society is giving way to a society of integration. We are undoubtedly making progress. The occupation, the silence, and the joy forbidden to women are disappearing. The battle is still sad, but women, more than ever, much more than ever, know our rights. In these years of hardship and misfortune, women's greatest fortune is their faith in themselves.
  
  What should the ideal woman be like?
  
  - The ideal woman doesn't exist; she's simply the sum of all women's desires. In any case, I think the ideal woman is one who never loses the attributes of her femininity, one who fights alongside men, one who resonates not only within herself but in her society, the woman who knows how to be a mother, wife, companion, and friend to her husband. The ideal woman is the Third World woman, who lives and fights for a world of love for all. At first, softly, like an undertow of ñukchus, like a sleeping river, a warm air from my homeland anchors my ears with those words, "capuli ñai cusqueñita, it's only your fault that you suffer so much..." Martha Falcon de Mantilla speaks with warmth, as if she were arguing; the inflections of her voice buttress each phrase with the severity of concrete, she underlines her ideas as if trying to place them in space with her hands. Martha Falcón talks to convince, to sow ideas. Her arguments rise like a wall, our questions stumble, but here we go:
  
  What was the most fulfilling moment of your life? -- The experience of becoming a mother. How many experiences? -- I have three children. Teenagers, young adults, children? -- Still children, for me my greatest treasure. I remember the Gracchi's mother.
  
  BEAUTY AND REVOLUTION: A TASK WITHOUT DISTANCES
  
  The conversation becomes intense. The sentences sparkle, the questions fall and rise, the answers shimmer on their own like on a mirror. Martha Falcón shines with the grace of a tuberose and the precision of an arrow. It's a luminous battle between us who ask questions and her who flips, zooms, and flares.
  
  Does beauty diminish, increase, or strengthen women's struggle for their rights?
  
  --For me, beauty is a sensitive soul in a beautiful woman. A beautiful body is simply like an empty pitcher; beauty without an admirable attitude is not beauty.
  
  -- Is behavior essential to beauty?
  
  Perhaps not always, but it is a complement. One without the other is a half-baked attitude. Women must be beautiful not only for omens or smiles, they must also be beautiful for their ideals, for their tribulations, for the hope that beats within them. Beauty in women is essential, but it is a vain word if it is dedicated only to the face, the intensity of the waist, or the possibilities of a smile. Beauty and revolution are a task without distances. Time is built from the habit of loving just things. As Luis de León said: The beauty of the face fades, the beauty of the soul always flourishes. As in Hippias's responses to Socrates, beauty is not what is useful or pleasing; it is appearance and being at the same time. Beauty is form, container, and content. Martha Falcón motivates this and other pseudo-philosophical musings. Her conviction and passion take us off topic.
  
  THE WIFE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL PRESIDENT
  
  You ask me about the President's wife, and I don't know what I admire most about her. Her dedication to the cause of the poor, her passion for Peru and her people, or her eagerness to sow good without the publicity of other times. Mrs. Consuelo Gonzáles de Velasco has made human kindness a profession of faith; she works tirelessly and valiantly for that essential pairing that is mother and child. I have never seen such fervor decreeing so much joy as in the hands of Mrs. Consuelo Gonzáles de Velasco.
  
  Would it be possible, Mrs. Martha, for us to report you to the wife of the President of the Republic?
  
  -- Come whenever you like. Mrs. Consuelo will be clear and precise with her answers. Like all the ladies of CONAMUP, we know the importance of the media and are willing to collaborate with journalism. -- What do you admire most about Mrs. Consuelo Gonzales de Velasco? -- The question is really difficult, like standing in front of the sea without knowing which horizon you like best. Mrs. Consuelo Gonzales de Velasco has truly exceptional qualities. Her capacity for work, her warmth, her kindness, that bohemian spirit she exudes in important tasks, I don't know... what to admire most about her. -- Is all the work the President's wife does done out of love for her husband or for political motivation?
  
  TIMES CHANGE AND MARGINALIZATION SHRINKS
  
  Women's liberation in our time is becoming a reality, but not simply a struggle against men, nor a confrontation between the sexes, much less a frustration caused by men. Women's liberation understood as the liberation of peoples from all forms of imperialism, a total break with the centers of power, with foreign capital, with all cultural and economic domination. Let us recall Juana de Asbaje's quartet: "What greater fault has there been in a misguided passion:/ she who falls while praying/ or he who prays while fallen." Now the struggle is not against men, but against the system that oppresses both.
  
  --What do you understand, Mrs. Martha, by women's liberation?
  
  --You just said that the fight is against dependency and we agree on that.
  
  Against what dependency? -- Against imperialism. The President of the Republic made it clear in his last message. Imperialism is not exclusive to capitalism.
  
  -- How do women fight against Imperialism? -- By militating in the ranks of the Revolution (let's put it with a capital R, as Valcárcel wants the REVOLUTION to be written). In the Peruvian Revolution, which is pluralistic, fully participatory, Christian, and socialist. Furthermore, women fight against imperialism, working for our people, encouraging and loving our lifelong companions, our husbands, and becoming aware of our role as women, mothers, and wives. The world cannot be explained without women, neither men alone, nor women singled out as women.
  
  DOMESTIC VIRTUES
  
  It seemed as if the room hardened with light, the hours rested for a moment in a second and continued their flow. The questions burst like trees, and the answers bore fruit. It was an intense dialogue, like scything away splinters and harvesting eaves. Pulling ourselves together, we returned to the charge:
  
  -- Are there domestic virtues? What would they be? -- If by domestic we mean the everyday, the domestic, the internal, the greatest virtue is dedication to children, caring for the home. I believe that fidelity, loyalty, and love for the truth are also everyday, as they are attitudes that are tested daily.
  
  --What is loyalty? --It is the dedication of a person to a cause or to another person. Loyalty is the first virtue of revolution and of the Fatherland; it would not exist, nor is friendship possible without the principle of loyalty. Perhaps loyalty is the only seed that spreads its roots among men, the smile that is always awaited, or the outstretched hand that is sought at some point in life. Martha Falcón speaks with knowledge of the subject; she has long been at the edge and center of everyday names and behaviors in national politics. The women of our time leave behind their emblems, take up their symbols, fight, and light bonfires, not in a narrow, regional feminist struggle, but in a much deeper and more transcendent struggle, in a battle for the people, for all the forgotten and marginalized of the Third World. For the emerging peoples of contemporary times, always swift, always fragile, and yet worthy of being lived, with all their risks and multitude of problems. As Martha Falcon's voice continues speaking to us from the tape recorder, at this moment, amid the serious faces of our editorial colleagues, amid the noise of teletypes threading together distances, amid the clamor, the defeats, and the victories of each and every particular existence, we think once again, not for the last time, but with greater intensity, about what Martha Falcón de Mantilla has just told us. Only loyalty builds peoples like water that nourishes the roots. (Angel Avendaño)
