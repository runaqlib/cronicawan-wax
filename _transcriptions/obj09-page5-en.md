  _On His Day: More Faith in Our People_
  
  Just as on the peaks the rocks disintegrate into sand, or on the riverbanks the trees dream of disappearing, watching the waters pass by, exactly like the frost that dawns gripped by the cold, so the men of our people on a land that was not theirs abjured themselves, only weeping, did they water their own suffering with their lives. For the men who worked in the furrows, it was the rains of fire; for them, the nettles of hatred, the black clouds, doubled. In the fields, death multiplied beyond the impossible, beyond counting. Only the gamonales fulfilled their wishes; they kept the life and death of the poor for themselves. And the animals, the lands, and the ayllus watered themselves with the thirst of the days; even the wind seemed to follow the flight of powerful hands. The men of the town buried their lives to receive death as payment, crucified, kicked, without their corn, without children, buried alive, they walked dispersed, the ancient warriors of Tupae Amaru,
  
  And when the powerful wanted to, they ordered the people to hold elections. They invented the name "elections." There, they danced only among the wealthy to the music of their money. In these so-called "elections," they hypnotized the poor with every imaginable offer. The candidates would say, "I'll give you this, I'll give you that, I'll give you whatever you want." But once they were elected, they traveled to Lima to kiss the hands of the local bosses. They deceived the people in the "parliament." They were magicians, sleeping on their navels, well-fed and well-drunk, without ever opening their mouths. Sometimes they remembered the peasants at banquet time; they wept for the poor with fake tears, calling out to them with moth-eaten tongues. Absolute silence pierced the story, and only the waters of the irrigation ditches moved in the fields. The whip continued to break the peasants' necks. That's what elections were for: to lull people to sleep, to live off these deceptions, just as carnival elections were masquerade balls where thoughts concocted by the boss and deceptions concocted by the master were equally distributed. Seeing these things, the peasants gathered together, made bridges of hands, and began to walk as one, until they decreed with their blood the dawn of the union, so that in the name of the rural poor, they would wage war against hatred. In the unions, men began to glimpse life. But they were treated worse than beasts; they were crucified beyond crucifixion, locked in jail, beaten, insulted with ferocious hatred. The union leaders suffered far more than the damned in hell. Agrarian reforms were nothing but deceptions. The laws were the decalogues of the gamonales (landlords); those agrarian reforms made by gamonales for the gamonales were new distributions among them, so that their lands would increase. The poor grew poorer every day, and the rich feasted on the misery of others until their thirst for wealth was satisfied. Death multiplied until it could no longer control the ayllus. This life seemed like a vein combing its misfortune in paths of tears; for moments and for centuries, the peasants suffered with diabolical precision all the scars of meekness; even the gods on the peaks seemed to bear the torments of the people. Those years were years of unliving, years of weeping, of bubbling wounds. The people of Peru were a single wound of repeated terrors, silent, closing their mouths, making suffering a habit, wandering with their load of misfortunes on their backs. When the crucified people, bound in body and soul, seemed to close their eyes to themselves, when they had the certainty of sandy roads, when they seemed to be shipwrecked, when only death limited the people, General Juan Velasco Alvarado built the Revolution, made it dawn,
  
  He had previously placed his heart like a flag and extended his life like a path. The Revolution arrived as if tears were borne from the depths of the earth. It returned the land to those who truly work it. With the Agrarian Reform, the Peruvian Revolution deepened its roots until it became a tree of eternal veins. The Revolution began to walk, sowing its seeds in Peruvian hearts. For that reason, no one can oppose this Revolution, nor can anything triumph over it in justice. When we think of the Agrarian Reform, we love the Revolution even more. We walk together with the Revolution, protecting it. We go forth, willing to shed our blood so that the Revolution does not stop. The Revolution is like the Sun; with its splendor, it forever banishes the years of suffering, the years of hunger. We must reach even more just days along the path of the Revolution. The Revolution colors the songs and the chakras alike. Let us swear in the name of the Revolution, in the revolutionary manliness of Juan Velasco Alvarado, in his meridian of thought, so that we may walk even more lightly, to lift up our people with the firmness that its eternity imposes. Only this Revolution makes us believe that joy is possible for the people of Peru. Before the Revolution, peasants gathered among peasants, mestizos among themselves; all groups sought out their own; the groups were countless, as if men from all the peoples of the earth gathered in our town. Now, mestizos, peasants, doctors, those who worked in the fields, those who drive flatbed trucks—we all feel like children of a common mother, Peru. The Revolution makes the most distant dreams present. Walking with her, we will reach back to the lost years so that the people may sing their true song. The Revolution is the sun that never goes out, the just path, the running water, the ember that never goes out. Every day we must look at the flags of the Revolution, which are the banners of the people. In the Revolution that advances, the soul of the people is realized. With the Revolution that rises, our people are built. The Revolution is the only path of the people, the shining path. The Revolution is an inseparable flame. On this National Day, CRONICAWAN, listening to the cries of the multitudes, embracing the hearts of the people, with the bubbling spirit of faith, salutes Peru. Never again will the winds of ancient hatreds return to these lands. Forever, until eternity, we are freer than before. With bread for all, with seed, with life, with fruits for all the people. LONG LIVE PERU FOR ALL ETERNITY.

  _THE NEW ONE IS ALREADY IN THIS HOUSE_DIRECTOR OF THE CHRONICLE
  
  On Saturday, the new directors of La Crónica arrived. They are, first, Mr. Luis Gonzales Posada, the Director, then Jorge Larrea Riofrio, Edmundo Vcra Solorzano, and Eduardo Gordillo Tordoya, members of the Committee. Those of us who work here welcomed the new directors of La Crónica with applause and joy. A little while earlier, with all our hearts and with the most noble sentiments, we bid farewell to Guillermo Thorndike, and amid kisses, applause, and tears, we said goodbye to his wife for her kind heart and kindness. Mr. Luis Gonzales Posada is an experienced journalist who has previously worked in newspapers and knows very well how a newspaper should be run. He has been heeding the Revolutionary Government's orders for this organization to move even more closely with the rhythm of the Revolution, so that it may continue to root the Revolution in the hearts of the people. As we already know, the bosses, the imperialist foreigners, biting with their hatred, lie and claim the transfer is untrue, but with events like those of these days, the frauds are being devastated, the distortions of deceitful tongues are being exposed. Certainly, no one can deny it, the newspapers are reaching the hands of the people. LA CRONICA will now report directly to the Presidential Palace of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. CRONICAWAN welcomes the new directors of this publication: Director Luis Gonzales Posada, Jorge Larrea Riofrio, Edmundo Vera Solorzano, and Edmundo Gordillo Tordoya, with great pleasure, with all our hearts, and we can only offer them our willingness to work and our spirit of collaboration.

  _IN THE YEAR OF THE WOMAN AND IN THE_DAY OF THE FATHERLAND, WE SALUTE ALL WOMEN.
  
  On this new National Day, on Peru's holiday, we recognize all women; we salute them, not only because life begins in their veins, nor because we begin to know the world through their eyes, nor because we are strengthened by breast milk. We salute with true fervor the women who work in the fields, the mothers who bury the seeds with their hands, those who carry their children on their backs and along tireless paths. It is the women of the people, with their hardships, who truly build the people, who put their hearts into it, who, weeping, are not afraid to make mistakes in good times and bad. Both men and women, on the day of our National Day, must swear within themselves, to strengthen themselves and carry our flag, for our people; they must give their hearts without much thought. Life would not exist, nor would songs or flowers exist, if there were no women. They are the joy of existence, but it is false that women suffer only at the hands of men. They endure the unspeakable with the petty hearts of local bosses, with the deafness of millionaires, with the selfishness of all human beings, with the nameless personalism. Through the President's wife, Consuelo Gonzales de Yclasco, we salute all the women of Peru on this new National Day.

  _What you sow today, you will reap tomorrow._
  
  And what was the life of children on this earth like? Who did they laugh with, who did they play with, whose joy it was? And how did they look back with their childlike eyes on those years? Asking these things, I return to the pain of other years; asking these things, I return to the embers of ever-present wounds; asking old questions, I am reborn in living wounds. When I recall those times, I find a time of bitterness. The rulers never knew anything about children, but they made the night darker and hid the people in that darkness. They never came close to joy; there were no toys for them to climb the hills, there was no bread for them. Every dawn surprised them barefoot in the thorn bushes, herding other owners' animals. In their poverty, they only knew toast and knew how to gather firewood; they knew dung. Children arrived in our town, living like old people, growing old, without even knowing childhood. Even before they had fully grown, they were beginning to age. With hands that hadn't yet learned toys, they began to grasp chakitajllas, until blisters covered their hands, until their hands swelled with exhaustion. Before they could even smile, they knew bitter languages. But it wasn't just that. Children who didn't know how to work opened their little hands begging for bread, and when the cold got too severe, they begged for warmth with those hands. It's enough to make the people resentful. If this town raises children like this, it's enough to flee this town. When this town takes care of children like this, it couldn't be, nor ever was, the life of men to live looking at such suffering, even worse to leave such suffering. That's why the makers of our revolution grow fonder of existence. Because of what this revolution did, existence is strengthened, and that very thing, tomorrow, will make our gratitude flourish. Perhaps we will not see the ripeness of the fruits in this time, nor will we know how to measure the greatness that is being forged. It will be the children who suffer who will reap the fruits. They will laugh tomorrow at this change that is taking place, when they have toys and flowers at will in their hands. This revolution is being made for them, it is for them that the people are being transformed, so that there are no more barefoot children, so that everyone has the footsteps of a man. The revolution is being made for children.
  
  **28/VII**
  
  On our people's day, we must think about these things: On the anniversaries of years past, without land, without food, hated by the white people, like the pigs relegated to the corners—that does not create an anniversary of the Homeland. And as we are living now, with land, treated equally as the white people, our language recognized in all its magnitude, we ourselves revalued for our efforts, dawning in the hearts of the people, holding our flags—now it is an anniversary of our Homeland. Meditating on this, we must ask ourselves: Has our way of life changed or not? Is the Revolution progressing or not? Looking at these truths among ourselves, within ourselves, we must ask ourselves: how long the road traveled from the years of mourning to these years of splendor, how has this ascent been possible, and if we have advanced so much, how will our children still walk, how will they ascend continuing the path of the revolution. Truly, only the revolution is the soul of the people.
