  _A young woman who works at the newspaper_think of the year of the woman like this.
  
  Women's liberation is a change in attitude and mentality that seeks equal rights with men. It means making women aware that their role in society is not limited to the walls of the home. Women's liberation is the participation of women, both in their ideas and actions, in the development of society. Men and women must share in the work, without any sense of superiority for men or inferiority for women. Discrimination is an attitude that men have always had toward women. Women have always had to remain within certain limits, those that were exclusively their responsibility in the home, with their husbands, and with their children. Discrimination is felt in different areas. As one analyzes the legal, marital, and, until recently, salary aspects of women's status, one can find a series of restrictions that prevent them from acting freely. There are groups in our society that still do not conceive of women's liberation, the demand for their rights, and equality with men in all aspects; I refer to these as pressure groups. It can no longer be said that the weaker sex exists. Now women are demonstrating that they are capable of facing any type of human endeavor, so much so that the revaluation of the sexes is almost a reality thanks to the fact that women themselves are fighting for it to happen. For a city woman to be able to speak about a peasant woman, or vice versa, on certain topics, is conditioned. In the first case, they will have to be imbued with the idiosyncrasies of peasant women, knowing their thoughts and how they respond to events that arise, both in their own environment and outside of it. If this were not the case, the woman mentioned could misinterpret the other's thoughts. Women's liberation movements challenge society because it establishes the patterns that women must follow, allowing them to be exploited and marginalized. Society, with all its prejudices, is what women's movements criticize. Today's women are fighting against all of this: traditional society, with its capitalist ideas.

  _WHAT MARIANA CALLE SAID_
  
  MARIANA CALLE, journalist, 24 years old. 1 -- What do you understand by women's liberation? MC: I understand that what this term encompasses cannot be understood as such in isolation. Does true male freedom exist? We have to see that throughout history there have been systems in which men have been exploited. Today, there is exploitation of man by man, and as long as exploitation exists, we cannot speak of freedom. The truth is that within systems of exploitation, women have had and continue to have to suffer a double burden: that of society as such, and that of man as a consequence of the same economic structure.
  
  2. - CRONICAWAN - What is discrimination and how do people feel about it? MC - What will happen the day men and women realize that we are partners, with the same capacity for work, with the same duties and rights? We both want to form a new society in which the human couple, man and woman, feel free from exploitation. This is what those in power don't want us to reach, because to achieve that society, the entire current system would have to be destroyed.
  
  Discrimination against women is seen in all areas of social activity. In the workplace, women are paid less for the same work as men. This happens in all fields, whether professional or labor, it's the same. CRONICAWAN. - Can a woman from the city speak for a rural woman, or vice versa, about pressure groups, women's liberation, or gender revaluation? MC - In my opinion, anyone who has firsthand experience with the way of life in a given type of society is the only one qualified to speak accurately about it. I don't believe that through books and/or stories, we can accurately understand the realities that unfold outside of us.
