  General Fernandez Maldonado is remembered in Ayabaca.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Ayabaca llaqtapi yuyarinku wamink'a Fernandez Maldonatuta_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The visit of the Minister of Energy and Mines, General Jorge Fernández Maldonado, and the important speech he gave in this town on Farmers' Day are considered an unprecedented historic event in Ayabaca.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In addition to being the first time a Minister of State visited that city, he mingled with the peasants and authorities, also highlighting the principles and actions of the Revolutionary Government through his words.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Peasant and institutional leaders have expressed their conviction that Minister Jorge Fernández Maldonado's speech has served as a true wake-up call for the working class against reactionary infiltration attempts in the Peruvian revolutionary process.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "We must deepen the Revolution and leave the forces of reaction further and further behind," said General Jorge Fernández Maldonado in one of his speeches.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **General Enrique Gallegos Plates Compensation in Agriculture**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Enrique Gallegos wamink'a kamachimanta rimamun_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Peruvian Revolution must find a compensation mechanism that allows all Peruvian peasants, without exception, the right to share in the benefits of excellent, well-irrigated land.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In this way, the capitalist model of agricultural associations will be overcome, and solidarity will also reach the economic level.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This opinion was expressed yesterday by the Minister of Agriculture, General Enrique Gallegos Venero, who arrived from Ayacucho after awarding nearly 50,000 hectares in Andahuaylas to celebrate Farmers' Day.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "The Cooperative Law is in the hands of a Commission that is studying its structural changes, since current cooperatives generally respond to a capitalist model. We have said this several times," Gallegos Venero said at a press conference held at Jorge Chávez International Airport.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He then said that within the set of agricultural associations created by the Peruvian Revolution, solidarity must be extended to the economic level.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "In other words," he noted, "we have to find a compensation mechanism, just like in mining. And we have to do the same in agriculture, because one hectare of land isn't always equal."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He indicated that there are hectares of very good, well-irrigated farmland. Likewise, there are hectares that, with the "Justas," can be used to plant some trees.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  "So when we talk about hectares of land, we have to specify what type of land and what type of irrigation. And since the allocation is for Peruvian farmers, everyone has the right to benefit," Minister Gallegos commented.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He then added emphatically: "There are some farmers who have received excellent lands. I believe it is a moral obligation to share the goodness of those lands with other farmers in Peru. In other words, the Revolution must find these mechanisms of compensation."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **Agrarian reform deepens**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Astawanmi agrarian reform kallpachakunqa_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The half million hectares that were handed over to farmers on June 24th are a tribute to the Agrarian Reform of the centuries-old exploited inhabitants of the Peruvian Sierra.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In this natural region, the process has not advanced at the same pace as on the coast in recent years due to the lack of a land registry, an essential requirement for the appropriation and expropriation process.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Other factors that delayed action in the Sierra have been the lack of land titles for numerous properties and the implementation of Decree Law 20136 on small and medium-sized properties, whereby files that were in advanced processing had to be returned to the Agricultural Zones to adapt them to the new regulations.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The June 24th land award covers twelve agricultural areas and nearly twenty thousand farming families, and is the largest mass award so far this year.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The attendance of six Ministers of State and other senior military leaders is a clear reflection of the momentum given to Agrarian Reform.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **Soy will be industrialized for human consumption**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Ruruta industrialisanqaku soybean, runaq mikhuanpaq_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  An experimental project that contemplates the industrialization of soybean paste for consumption has been submitted by the Agrarian University of La Molina to the Ministry of Food, according to Engineer Fernando Hurtado Pascual, head of the Department of Food Technology and Agricultural Products at the university.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The project contemplates the industrialization of soybean paste to obtain milk and flour, which can then be used to produce a range of derivative products, such as noodles, bread, cookies, and ojuelos (a type of potato chip).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Engineer Pode Pascual also indicated that soybean paste is the residue left behind after the oil has been extracted from the plant's grain for industrial purposes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He clarified that despite this circumstance, the pasta retains the same protein content of 40 percent, "a figure that speaks for itself of the plant's great nutritional value."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The aforementioned engineer Hurtado also stated, "The Ministry of Food is interested in exploiting soy for human consumption."
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Thus, the Ministry has decreed the intensification of its cultivation throughout the country.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  **Peasant training**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Kanpisinukunata yachachinqaku_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  According to newspaper reports, the Revolutionary Government will regulate the training policy for the national peasantry, and the CNA will play a leading role in its implementation.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Education, Agriculture, Food, Sinamos, and CNA sectors participated in the preliminary draft of the mechanism to implement this important task.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Minister of Education's statements regarding the peasant training initiatives his ministry will soon launch in close coordination with the National Agrarian Confederation are gratifying.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This work—described as a high priority—requires combined efforts and resources to effectively deliver education to the countryside. In this regard, the inclusion of media outlets such as radio is of paramount importance in this endeavor, which has been entrusted to the Directorate of Basic Vocational Education.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  General Ramón Miranda Ampuero's attitude is satisfying and eloquent in itself, as he adopts an eminently participatory position in this new educational aspect that the Revolution has decided to undertake.
