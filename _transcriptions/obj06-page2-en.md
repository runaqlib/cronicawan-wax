  _QUYLLURCHAY_
  
  Yesterday, the Revolutionary Government issued the legal instrument that activates the transfer of national circulation newspapers to organized social sectors. This is the Regulation of the Civil Associations Owning Nationally Distributed Newspapers, with more than 200 articles published in the official newspaper "El Peruano." Twenty-six days before the date set for the conclusion of the current steering and reorganizing committees appointed by the Revolutionary Government upon expropriating the major press organs that formerly served the interests of the IAPA, it can be said that the transfer is underway. Indeed, it has been repeatedly stated that the transfer is a process, not a handover of the keys. And that this process must begin before July 27th, when, for the first year of socialization and due to the detected infiltration of interests alien to the ideology of our Revolution, the Revolution will appoint the new directors of the newspapers. These will operate, according to the Regulations announced yesterday, integrated into Boards of Directors of eleven members, seven of them delegates from the General Assembly of the assigned sector and the remaining three representatives of the labor community, at least one of them a journalist. There will also be, as specified in the Regulations, special advisory committees composed of professional journalists.

  Press workers closed ranks yesterday around the task of unifying the national journalism in accordance with the wishes of the Leader of the Revolution, while the country's various organized social sectors also began holding working meetings and analyzing the documents issued by the Revolutionary Government, in order to finalize the transfer of national circulation newspapers. Likewise, the infiltration maneuvers of the Director of Ultima Hora, Ismael Frias, to foment confusion surrounding the unifying work of journalists were revealed. Yesterday, the workers of LA CRONICA, the Telecentro Journalists' Circle, Ultima Hom, and the United Front of Expreso and Extra, declared themselves in favor of unification, endorsed the Ideological Bases of the Peruvian Revolution, and requested that the Press Secretary of the Presidency of the Republic, Augusto Zimmermann Zavala, continue to lead the Unified Commission at the national level in his capacity as General Coordinator. Previously, workers from La Prensa, Comercio, Correo, and Ojo made similar statements.

  _ILLAPACHAY_
  
  An advisory body to the Prime Minister, Major General Francisco Morales Berndez, which will be composed of qualified workers and professionals, has been created by the Revolutionary Government within the framework of the fully participatory Social Democracy it advocates. This is the Prime Minister's Advisory Council, which, in accordance with the Ideological Foundations of the Peruvian Revolution, will include among its members workers linked to various socioeconomic activities. As is known, these foundations postulate "that power and decisions arise with the least possible intermediation, from the social base in accordance with the interests of the entire nation." Precisely in the explanatory section of Supreme Decree No. 015, which created the aforementioned Council, it is recalled that the Prime Minister participates in the conduct of government policy and that the objective of the Revolutionary Government is to promote participatory dialogue with the grassroots population. Thus, the incorporation of workers into this high advisory body will give the labor sectors of the population direct and broad participation in the decision-making of the Revolutionary Government. All of these individuals must not belong to the Public Administration and will join the advisory body in a personal capacity, ad honorem and at the invitation of the Prime Minister.

  _INTICHAY_
  
  The Revolutionary Government has determined that young people graduating from the universities should go to the towns in the interior of the country to put into practice what they have learned. This work is called "Civil Service." It is very good that young students take with their own hands everything they have assimilated to the common people. As we already know, in the books and studies of young students, the university uses the people's money. In the past, these young people stayed in the big cities, flattering the wealthy, treating only the sick who had money, selling palliatives to the poor, and so on.
  
  illnesses. Those young men did not cure the common people; they did not even know the wretched villages. It is now, when those young men will see with their own eyes, soothe with their precognitive hands the wounds of the poor. They will know how the common people suffer, how the common people die, finding death just like beasts. It is very good for the young students to go to the most distant villages; it is very good for them to stay there for a year. In that time, they will know the true suffering of the people and the needs of the humble.
