  **CIVIL SERVICE OF GRADUANTS**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Revolutionary Government has ordered the creation of the Civil Service of Graduates. This provision seeks to ensure that all those who study at universities as a requirement to be professionals must provide services in the areas and
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  towns furthest from the country. That is a good measure for all Peruvians, just as we contribute with our money for the existence of the Universities, and in this way the studies of these students can be sustained, and then, with the
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The knowledge that they acquire in this way will earn them money, so first, at least in a small way, they must give back to the people something that the people themselves have given them. We know this as the Graduating Civil Service. SECIGRA.

  The history of our people has to be written again. If you truly want to know war and peace in ancient times, you must review history. How they lived, what their temples were like, everything has to be looked at from another perspective. In order not to make mistakes again in this new story, they must know Quechua perfectly. Quechua is the soul of our people, it is the root of the multitude, the brain of the people. Ancient men put their experiences into Quechua. If you do not know the breadth of Quechua, it is impossible to know the growth of Peru.

  **continue with firm step**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Peruvian Revolution continues with a firm and determined step, its liberating sowing and its construction work will not stop for a moment nor will it suffer any decline. The men have taken over, the task does not pause. By Institutionalized decision of the Armed Forces, General Juan Velasco Alvarado has been replaced by General Francisco Morales Bermúdez. He will lead the destinies of Peru towards the goals outlined in the Inca Plan, The Revolutionary Statute and the Deological Bases of the Peruvian Revolution. The men of Peru who have rescued their children forever, the outcasts and the dispossessed of before, who now use and plant their own lands, have to see in the change a principle of renewal and consolidation of the conquests they have been achieving. The people and their Armed Forces have embarked on a path from which no one and nothing will make them turn back. The great revolutionary movements - like ours - are defended by the truth of the justice they impose and by the achievements they achieve in favor of the dispossessed majorities. The flags of the people are in revolutionary fists, a difficult and challenging path awaits us. The unity of the Armed Forces is the greatest guarantee for the success and final triumph of the Peruvian Revolutionary Process. Because we fully trust the leaders of the Revolution, we have more faith and we believe in its deepening.
