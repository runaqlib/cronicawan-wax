  **This is what the FARTAC leader said**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Aqnata rimamun FARTAC umalliq_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Tupaq Amaru Revolutionary Agrarian Federation of Cusco currently has fourteen agrarian leagues, which comply with the law.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now the "Agrarian League of the Convention" has been formed, for that reason, we interviewed Bruno Cabrera, Secretary General of FARTAC, who gave us the following statement:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.— How do you view the development of the Agrarian Reform on its sixth anniversary?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  BRUNO CABRERA.— I see the sixth anniversary of the Agrarian Reform like this: Before, when this law had not yet been passed, the local bosses treated the peasants as they pleased, making them work like slaves, as if they were tied to the legs of a horse.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Seeing this reality, the Revolutionary Government and our elder brother Juan Velasco passed Law No. 17716, so that farmers would no longer be treated like this. For this reason, we are extremely happy.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.- How is the FARTAC, is it developing well?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  BRUNO CABRERA.— FARTAC was organized with only seven agricultural leagues; to date, we have already added fourteen leagues.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But let's be honest and say that we still need some organization and training in these leagues, in the rural communities. We need to further train the leaders and community members. What's more, there are many problems.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There are problems with the authorities. Some of them are very good, but there are other authorities who don't walk well, they walk crookedly.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now, we're happy because the Agrarian League of the Convention has been organized, and that's very good; there was a lot of fighting there against injustice, a brave fight for land.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.- How was that?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  BRUNO CABRERA.— There, a single man owned vast tracts of land; hills and plains belonged to a single man. The rest of the men were marginalized, like dogs who were given a little bit of lahua to eat, and by feeding them only that, they were forced to work.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  They were made to work for only twenty or fifty cents, and if it rained, they weren't even paid that much on rainy days. The men were treated as if they were guilty. That's how it was.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Seeing all this, Hugo Blanco stood up, formed unions there, and it is precisely in that area that the Agrarian League has now been formed. Its leadership is scheduled to be sworn in on the 29th in the city of Quillabamba.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  That is the importance of this league, as I stated earlier.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this swearing-in, some 20,000 farmers will be mobilized; that day will be one of great joy and happiness.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Several agricultural leagues will even be present in Quillabamba that day.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN.— Do you want to say something to the peasants of Peru?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  BRUNO CABRERA.— My heartfelt greetings to all the farmers of Peru, to my fellow farm workers, on June 24th being Farmers' Day.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I also salute the elder brother of the peasants, Juan Velasco Alvarado, who suffered as a soldier, who saw our suffering, and who therefore passed this law for the peasants. That's why I salute him.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  He saw the suffering of many men, and so that they would no longer suffer in that way, on June 24 he gave the law.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Long live Juan Velasco Alvarado forever!
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Likewise, may the workers in the fields live forever.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Long live the agrarian leagues and federations in the same way, and long live our governing organization, the National Agrarian Confederation.
