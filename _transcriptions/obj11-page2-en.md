  _SUNDAY_
  
  Our newspaper reaches its tenth issue. Time is truly short to take stock, but the ten issues published are a resounding lie to the skeptics who viewed with calculated disbelief the possibility of a weekly newspaper written entirely in Quechua being successful. We have counted and continue to count on the determined support of those at the helm of LA CRONICA, their constant encouragement and support, the public's welcome, the numerous letters, and the reviews that tell us that we have a confident readership, aware of the literary and journalistic possibilities of the Quechua language. The prevailing anarchy in Quechua writing, its various dialectal forms, and the fact that the weekly CRONICAWAN has not yet reached the most remote corners of the country, diminish its possibilities of dissemination and sales. As Quechua returns to the essence of deep Peru, CRONICAWAN will become indispensable.

  _MONDAY_
  
  Bolivia Day
  
  Bolivia, the country of the high plateau, celebrates its national anniversary and the 150th anniversary of its emancipation from Spain. The people of Bolivia express their joy of freedom in an extensive program of popular celebrations. Peru and Bolivia are sister nations; identical ethno-historical roots unite them, both in their origins and in much of their existence. Both peoples formed a unity from the great Tiaanaku until August 6, 1825, when Upper Peru decided to emancipate itself in accordance with the principle of self-determination of peoples and the utiposidetis. Bolivia, like Peru, has a broad aboriginal social base; they also speak Quechua and consider themselves descendants of the Incas. In their customs, their ways of life, and their aspirations, they are essentially united with Peru. On this anniversary of Bolivia, we salute the Bolivian people, hoping that the future will bring all the achievements that the liberators dreamed of for the homeland of Bartolina Sisa and Tupac Catari.

  Representing the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, Major General Francisco Morales Bermúdez, Minister of War and Premier of the Cabinet, traveled to La Paz, Bolivia. Morales Bermúdez conveyed greetings from General Juan Velasco Alvarado to President Hugo Banzer. The Premier of the Peruvian Cabinet will be present at the celebration of the sesquicentennial of the independence of the Altiplano country, testifying to Peru's support and presence in the libertarian jubilation of the Bolivian people. Morales Bermúdez is also responsible for conveying to Bolivia Peru's wishes for a just and prompt solution to the landlocked situation of the Altiplano country within a framework of peace and American harmony. Deep and indestructible ethno-historical ties unite Peru and Bolivia, from the distant culture of the Tiavvanakus until August 6, 1825, when they formed a single nation within a vast territory. Currently, Peru and Bolivia are seeking comprehensive solutions to their underdevelopment and dependency through their own means. CRONICAWAN GREETS the Bolivian people on their Sesquicentennial.

  Junín represents the definitive debacle of the Royalist army, which sought to continue the unjust domination under which the Peruvian people struggled. On August 6, 1825, patriotic and royalist cavalry clashed in a battle in which not a single revolver shot was fired. The relentless firmness, bravery, and libertarian faith of the patriotic army emerged triumphant from the armed confrontation. We remember Junín for the motivations of dignity and justice that flew on the patriotic flags, for the determination and courage with which the armies of Rázuri, Miller, Castilla, Gamarra, La Mar, and Necochea attacked their adversaries, for the founding of a homeland without exploiters or exploited, which the Battle of Junín represented. The work of those great men of Junín becomes a clear historical reality with the path taken by our contemporary army, busy continuing the work of the liberators in their search for the definitive economic independence of Peru.

  General Miguel Angel de la Flor Valle expressed the discontent of the Non-Aligned countries at a recent press conference in Geneva, referring to Henry Kissinger's attack on the Third World, describing it as the alignment of the non-aligned. On this occasion, the Peruvian representative defined this bloc as a group of nations that resolutely wish to distance themselves from the interests of the great powers and avoid the traps of the dominant ideologies of the East and West, returning to the principles of self-determination of peoples without supervision and the establishment of a new international order. Today in Switzerland, and in the media close to Geneva, concern was expressed unanimously over the strange rigidity of the United States toward the Third World. For this reason, they highlight the forceful response of Foreign Minister Miguel Angel de la Flor Valle.

  _FRIDAY_
  
  Yesterday, Thursday, the peoples of Peru and France reestablished diplomatic relations with France at the Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific, at the ambassadorial level. Relations were severed by a unilateral decision of our people in condemnation of the explosions. A joint statement, released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed this event, which was reported in the press.
  
  We consider this event important, as it promotes and strengthens the ties that have always united the two peoples.

  The Andean Group countries, including Peru, possess enormous oil, fishing, and mining potential, placing them ahead of other Latin American nations outside this bloc, according to figures presented yesterday by Dr. Javier Silva Ructe, Director-Secretary of the Board of the Cartagena Agreement. Silva Ructe revealed that 93 percent of the total copper extracted in Latin America comes from the Andean Subregion, which, in turn, produces 81 percent of its oil and 83 percent of its fish. These figures were released just over six years after the agreement was enacted, and they are yielding extraordinary results. Thus, solid bonds of interdependence are being created throughout the Andean Group.
