  **BAHA'IS ALSO SPEAK QUECHUA**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The meeting of Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru took place in the city of Cuzco, on the occasion of the Baha'i fraternity in which the OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS "RUNA SIMI" where they exchanged their ideals and experiences. The objective of this meeting was essentially to find a human existence in the world, through the brotherhood of the human person and working with the understanding of a single language, especially for the large peasant multitude. The mature thinking of the Baha'is has been crystallized in this significant international meeting of the participating countries. GREAT COLISEUM OF CUZCO The representation of the Baha'is of Bolivia demonstrated the wide repertoire of their folklore in the Coliseum of Cusco. The Director of the folklore group is Rogelio Cerro Grande with the charango members: Amadeo Willkay Clemente Pimentel; in the sampoña there are Esteban Pachecho and Martín Terrazas, in the quena there are CiriloIsla, Luis Hurtado and Martin Willka. Among the vocalists are HildaBermúdez and Gregoria Inka. The songs performed are Takiraris, waynos and yarabís. With the interpretation of these messages of popular sentiment, they sowed the seeds of brotherhood and joy in the environments of the three participating countries. THE REPRESENTATIVES OF ECUADOR They also, in turn, brought their folklore as a bouquet of brotherhood from country to country, to offer the hearts of the Ecuadorian people in the city of Cusco. Luis Antonio Castañeda is the Director of the ensemble and is, at the same time, a great artist who masters the melodica. He is accompanied by: Luis Arias and Pedro Andrango on guitar, on bass drum, Rafael Conderón. They are the representation of the agrarian zone of the city of Otavalo and they brought the song, dance and music to present in this international event, "Chinvalito "Alegre San Juanito "Agato manda runa", "Invabura alvaza" were the joyful interpretations, which with peculiar propriety they offered with these beautiful expressions of native folklore with which the members of the International Conference enjoyed great joy, filled with the same heart, thus strengthening a lasting fraternity so that in the future they continue working under the flag of the Baha'is in search of a humane existence, more just, more supportive and more humane (Dr. Nelly Castratt de Zlatar).

  THE RIVERS I Rivers do not only escort fish, nor do they tarnish the patina of time as if it were the dust of the earth. The rivers spread and engulf scars, like bottomless mirrors they resemble the wind and walk silently. The rivers are the cry of the hills, the soul of the snow, the sadness of the roots. The rivers only know how to leave, running tirelessly to discover the unknown and are not saddened by what they leave behind. As if they were the breath of the gods, they turn the clods into wormwood. They go up and down, twisting like the body of a snake. Sometimes, suddenly screaming, they get lost in the heart of the hills, the rivers have fever in the bend of the hills, between the fingers of the roots, in the center of the deserts. The rainbow and even the lightning are buried in the body of the rivers. All rivers are like men who have no people. It is sad to sit on the banks of rivers. It is as if the river rose to the heart without being seen, sadness unexpectedly arrives like the hand of a great lake, with the hateful fire of its eyes, then, inexplicably, on our chest the song of death laces its nest. Our life is like the river, it always leaves and never returns, little by little it becomes far away, fading into itself, on its back it carries tears, it carries sorrows. The rivers water the thirst of the farms, they green the secret of the wastelands, the rivers are the veins of the furrows, through the rivers the corn has corn, the potatoes have fruit, and there is tarwi in the grasslands, only through the rivers does man reach his food.
