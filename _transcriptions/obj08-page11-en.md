  **MOTHER OF GOD MUSPHAN YAWAR**CH'UNQAKUNAN MAKIMPI**
  
  _MOTHER OF GOD IS STILL DREAMING_IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SUCK HIS BLOOD
  
  A bright mountain sun violently plunges down, flooding everything: the modern iron and glass architecture of the Velasco Astete airport, the foothills dotted with white shacks, and the distant, snowy Salcantay. It's eight thirty in the morning in Cuzco. At that hour, the same hour when torrents of tourists laden with cameras disembark from the planes from Lima, a Tin Otter is warming up its engines. Ready to board the plane are a dozen workers with their briefcases and their faces full of anxiety and impatience. We chat with one of them. "We're GSI (Geophysical Service International) workers and we're going to Madre de Dios," he says. "I've been in the hospital for over a week, but I'm better now," says another. "I can't get used to this cold; you can't even bathe. I can't wait to get to Maldonado," complains a young worker. "At nine in the morning, the twin-engine plane painted in a red stripe is scurrying around." down the runway and soars into the mountains. An hour and a half later, the twin-engine plane rented by GSI lands at "Padre Aldamiz" Airport in Puerto Maldonado.
  
  In just ninety minutes, the modern little plane has landed over the Hualla-Hualla: it has flown over Marcapata Quincemil and soared into the immense green space that seems like an unfathomable ocean. It is the same route that truck drivers travel in good weather in three days and in rainy seasons in one or two months, when the Quincemil-Maldonado Highway is a muddy path that clogs even the hopes of the people of Maldonado; this is perhaps the same route that Juan Alvarado Maldonado traveled in 1567, and it is possible that Faustino Maldonado may have seen these same paths and skies in 1860, and perhaps before them, the Inca Yupanqui tried along these trails to reach Amaru Mayo (River of Snakes) when, in vain, he tried with ten thousand men to conquer the enigmatic and terrible Antisuyo.
  
  THE SAD TROPICS
  
  But it's not just distance that separates Cuzco from Madre de Dios, or Lima from Madre de Dios, or all of Peru from Puerto Maldonado or Iñapari. It's everything. It's a whole that reveals itself harshly, without hesitation, the very moment the traveler peers into these towns of Madre de Dios, Maldonado, Iberia, Iñapari, Fortaleza, San Lorenzo. These are the towns Levi-Strauss described in Tristes Trópicos, sad towns, crushed by the tropical sun, by distance and isolation: towns and regions subjected and punished by the most savage capitalism: the one that makes tropical regions the economic frontiers of the Third World, where the most brutal systems of exploitation of raw materials and of humanity are established.
  
  OIL AND SOMETHING ELSE
  
  At midday, the sun sets scorchingly in Puerto Maldonado. The Madre de Dios River flows, as Neruda wished, "like a planetary road." The city has a feverish atmosphere. Someone had already told us at the hotel that Puerto Maldonado is not the same city it was a year ago. Since the oil exploration companies moved into the Department, many things have changed here. For now, there are a dozen self-sufficient workers (white leprosy in the small town).
  
  city ​​hospital, and a larger number are undergoing treatment in Cuzco, but the majority are in the camps of Lagarto, Rio Piedras, and Manu. Here is the version of two workers about the uta. "There's a lot of uta in Manu: a lot of uta has appeared there. They say it's from the water or that a mosquito brings it. I don't know anymore, but there's a lot of uta because of the company that takes us to places where there is disease," declares a worker of about 25 years old, a native of the region. "They are to blame. When they are sick, they don't take care of themselves. They suck, they go to brothels, they eat pork, they throw away their money, who is going to get better like that?" says another, whose tone undoubtedly reflects the mentality and opinions of the bosses. He is a privileged worker who does not sink in the swamps of the Rio Piedras: he works registering the cargo that the planes rented by the GSI transport to Puerto Maldonado. But the effects of oil exploration don't end there. They don't end with the plight of the self-sufficient workers. The cost of living in Puerto Maldonado has skyrocketed. A chicken that cost fifteen pounds a year ago now costs 400 soles. Oil managers and technicians happily pay these prices. The bars are always packed with customers, almost all of them workers who, after three months of confinement, are capable of drinking even the Madre de Dios: they disembark in the city with their bundle of shirts and pants and a jumble of bills and set out to conquer pleasure. As in Iquitos, as in Pucallapa and Yurimaguas, where trocheros (recruitment camps) have been set up, oil exploration, with its millions of soles, its large machinery, and its technocrats, has shattered the old way of life of these people, who until recently were sleeping a peaceful, tropical siesta. As in Iquitos, Pucallpa and Yurimaguas, in Puerto Maldonado there is also a small urban layer of merchants who own restaurants and bars, bazaars and brothels, who turn the sad drunken binges of thousands of drug dealers into cash and fat bank accounts: they are fattened by all the social disorder generated by the multi-million dollar oil investment in the weak and artificial economic structure of these towns.
  
  There's yet another problem. Maldonado, Iberia, and Iñapari are running out of workers. All the workers are going into the oil industry. "Soon, if things continue like this, there won't be anyone on the farms," ​​declared an alarmed official from the Iberia Agricultural Development Bank.
  
  THE CHIMERA OF GOLD
  
  But it's not just oil that drives the men of Madre de Dios from their precarious agricultural settlements; it's also the dream of gold, as in the unforgettable Charlie Chaplin film. They flee with their poverty, their wives, and their hopes: they set out in waves toward Inambari: toward the beaches of Madre de Dios. It's estimated that a little more than three thousand men cripple their hands and break their backs in the furious jungle sun on the beaches to produce 30 percent of the gold currently produced in Peru. In Mazuco, Middle Inambari, I speak with one of these workers. He refuses to give me his name. He is a pale man, with wounds on his face and arms from mosquito bites. Fearfully, constantly looking along the road where the fierce and feared gaze of his boss appears from time to time, he tells me he earns seventy soles a day. Social Security? No. I don't know what that is. "They only pay me seventy soles a day and I work from six to six," he says suspiciously. Ten meters away, on a fence, a young woman, also pale and with disheveled hair, is cooking bananas, and a pantsless boy is playing innocently in the sand, digging holes with his feet. "I'm from Macusani and I'm 28 years old. I've been here for six years," he says later. "Go back? I have to pay my bill to the boss first. I don't know when because everything is so expensive here: these bosses screw you, they do whatever they want, they abuse you," he complains. There are more than three thousand like this man in Madre de Dios, spread across the beaches of Madre de Dios, Tambopata, Inambari, Piedras, and other alluvial plains. It's estimated they produce 70 kilos of gold a month, earning 70 soles a day, working from "six to six." They are subject to a system of engagement by a hundred employers, "small miners", according to the innocent terminology of the Mining Bank from which they receive
  
  All kinds of aid: long-term loans, facilities for the supply of tools and food. An example of a boss is Barazona, practically the owner of Mazuco. Barazona owns the town's only hotel, the only restaurant, the only store. If anyone comes to Mazuco—a gold panner, journalist, anthropologist, adventurer, engineer, etc.—they will inevitably fall into Barazona's clutches. There is no escape. He is the typical village example of the vicious circle of commercial capitalism's internal domination.
  
  FOR WHOM THE CHESTNUTS TOLL
  
  "What do you expect these men to do? Stay here planting rice and then have no one to sell it to?" a resident of Iberia argues angrily when I try to explain the advantages of agriculture in the region. In this regard, they tell me stories that border on the incredible: of farmers grouped together who grew corn, but after a year of work, they don't know what to do with their produce; of certain days when no one wants to buy the meat hanging on the hooks in the Iberis market; of beans for which in this city no one wants to pay SJ. 8.90 a kilo, and which on the other side of the border, in Paraguazu, fetches the equivalent of 70 to 80 soles a kilo. Look, in 1972 I dedicated myself to rice. I planted two hectares and produced approximately 1,600 kilos. The bank gave me a loan of SJ. 5,600. "After selling the rice with great difficulty and paying off the loan, I had a small balance of SJ. 2,600 for almost a year of work," mocks a former farmer who since 1974 has become a log driver on the Piedras River, earning, according to his calculations, up to three thousand soles a month. "Oil, gold, and commerce are driving farmers off their land. But there must be a force greater than all others: the vicious circle of commercialization and the dominance exercised over it by two or three commercial monopolies. Otherwise, the situation of a region of 78,000 square kilometers, with 27,000 inhabitants and with possibly the most fertile ecological zones in the Peruvian Amazon, cannot be explained. Because Madre de Dios, according to scientific studies, has everything: from areas of dry tropical forest, to areas of humid tropical forest, to areas of
  
  A humid subtropical region capable of producing everything from the finest wood and chestnuts to papayas and delicate cherimoyas. Wood, gold, and chestnuts that only serve to enrich four or five capitalists. The chestnut is a prime example. At least 600 families in Madre de Dios are dedicated to harvesting chestnuts, under the harshest working conditions imaginable. They carry heavy barrels on their backs on long stretches that stretch for kilometers to the town, where the collection center is located. Until recently, the Ministry of Agriculture almost gratuitously granted concession contracts for chestnut extraction. But those who received these concessions were not the actual extractors, but the merchants who then "hooked" legions of harvesters from whom they bought the peeled chestnuts at the ridiculous price of 28 soles per kilo. The concessionaire, in turn, sold the product to the wholesaler, earning 200 or 300 percent. The system hasn't changed for a moment, but it's being severely undermined, challenged by the Tambopata Agrarian Production Cooperative in one of the most heroic and exemplary struggles to liquidate and break one of the most powerful links in human exploitation in the region. It's a fight between David and Goliath. David is the Cooperative, and Goliath is the two commercial monopolies of the southern region: El Sol and Comersa, companies that buy chestnuts and timber. Never before has anyone been able to challenge the power of these two companies, which reigned like two all-powerful sovereigns, cordially sharing the misery and hard work of thousands of chestnut and timber harvesters. The true story of this struggle began last year, after a period of organization and strengthening of the Cooperative, whose production has reached 300 MT of peeled chestnuts. With such a level of organization and production volume, the CAP could afford to exert a certain amount of pressure on the two monopolies, playing a bit with the law of supply and demand. They refused to accept the ridiculous price of 28 soles, and the monopolists ultimately agreed to pay 48 soles per kilogram in Puerto Maldonado, a price that was absolutely unheard of in the regional market.
  
  But this year, the two octopuses were completely enraged. There was no way they would accept a "thing called Cooperative with 30 starving cholos, advised by communists" challenging their tremendous power. So they ordered their front men not to buy chestnuts from the Tambopata Agricultural and Livestock Commission (CAP) unless they "accepted the price of 35 soles per kilo," arguing that the international crisis "did not allow for paying more." The same excuses as always. The crisis of capitalism falling on the backs of the workers. The CAP didn't budge. And just when things were looking a little bleak for chestnuts, the Huancaro Agricultural and Livestock Fair opened in Cuzco, organized by the "Tupac Amaru" Revolutionary Agrarian Federation (FARTAC). They transported 6 tons of chestnuts to Huancaro, which sold in six days for 50 soles per kilo. Now, the CAP must be selling chestnuts at bargain prices since yesterday at the Home Fair here in Lima, where a kilo of second-rate chestnuts usually doesn't go below S. 160. It would be naive to think that the octopuses have given up. defeated. The morsel is too succulent to be snatched away just like that. Let's compare. Chestnut production in Madre de Dios amounts to one million kilos, which means, in cash, 50 million soles. Of this total, the Tambopata CAP only produces 300 tons. Almost nothing. But the problem, for the conglomerates, isn't quantity. Because after all, it wouldn't be a problem to leave a pittance of millions to the CAP, when they skim off most of the 50 million produced by the chestnut. The "danger" for them lies in the CAP's bad example, just as the cohesion and integration of Third World countries is for capitalist imperialism. A single poor person has no power. But if 30 or 100 poor people unite, they become stronger. Then, war must be declared. That bloodless but deadly war of sabotage, of strangulation. In Madre de Dios, everyone is an enemy of the CAP. Everyone speaks ill of the CAP, because that's what the conglomerates have arranged. Since they dominate commerce, the institutions (until recently the manager of "El Sol" was mayor of Madre de Dios, just as the mayor of Lamas is a buyer and agent for "Comercial South America" ​​of Iquitos, a tentacle of FABRIL in the Amazon), credit, social relations, transportation, the CAP resists a real siege.
  
  The octopuses will try by all means to liquidate the CAP "Tambopata" because it represents the clearest, most objective option for the peasantry and workers in general, to liquidate the current system of exploitation, monopolistic and plundering, and replace it with another, a more rational, economically and socially equitable system. A marketing and production system that could be expanded, in terms of its design, social and economic objectives, and the entire regional economy: production, transportation and marketing of wood, chestnuts, gold from transport, etc. All of this in a first stage of restructuring of the most savage and grotesque system of economic frontier that survives in the country, to then, in a higher stage, advance towards social ownership. The structure of internal domination, the enclave status of Cuzco and Arequipa commercial capitalism that Madre de Dios has, offers the most objective conditions to make the region a laboratory of experiences in social ownership in the Peruvian Amazon. The same siege that the "Tambopata" CAP is currently being resisted by the "Tahuamanu" CAP and the Production and Work Cooperative formed by the Iberian rubber tappers.
  
  "They earn more by not seeing"
  
  With timber, the same thing happens as with chestnuts. We have not been able to determine the volume of logging that leaves the Department, nor the number of extraction licenses that the Ministry of Agriculture granted before the enactment of the Forestry and Fauna Law. But these licenses total several hundred. These licenses were not granted to the actual extractors, but to the bosses and permitters, since the same exploitation chain exists as in the rest of the Amazon. Logically, thousands of extractors work for hundreds of permitters and, fundamentally, for the large timber traders who are, no less and no more, the same as those involved in the chestnut trade, including another giant from the south of the country, "Sarfaty." One must imagine the effort involved in extracting timber and then selling it at 2.40 per foot for the best wood, which, in Cusco, Arequipa, and Lima, reached prices of 16, 20, and 30 soles per foot.
  
  Oversight of licensing, price controls, and payment of fees are routinely a dead letter on this economic frontier. "Here, officials earn more by not seeing than by seeing," a merchant cynically told us in Iñapari, on the border with Brazil.
  
  ROADS YES, BUT WITH TRANSFORMATION
  
  "Nothing has happened here, everything is back to zero," a local authority tells me as we have a soft drink at I Genovesa. I disagree with that opinion. Many things have happened in Madre de Dios since the last century, when the rubber tappers massacred the native groups. Nowadays, there are only occasional massacres. But the natives are tied to the ethnocentric and domineering chain of the missionaries, as Bernal Lelong harshly denounces in his beautiful and desperate book "Shinkibeni, the River of Corn." And according to the objective testimonies of the Shintuya Mission. There is also the history of the struggles of the rubber tappers' union of Iberia, who are the vanguard of the organization and struggle in that region of the country. A history that deserves not these lines or a chronicle, but a book that tells, among other things, how the union paid a salary for years to one of its leaders, an APRA member, who lived comfortably in Lima "running errands" while The rubber tappers spat blood on the roads. There are also the demands of the people of this region for a good road that connects them to what they call "civilization." A necessary road, like others that should connect Maldonado with Ibcria and Iñapari. But let the road arrive when the socioeconomic transformation of this region also arrives, because otherwise, as has been happening until now wherever the revolutionary tool has not yet reached, the road becomes a long and strong arm of the exploiters. A wider and closer path to reach the farms of the natives and other farmers. If not, gold, the wealth of Madre de Dios, will be only a pipe dream for the poor, as it is now.
