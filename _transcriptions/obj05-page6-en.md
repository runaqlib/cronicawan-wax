  **This is how man became man**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  _Hinatan runa runayaran_
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  …As we have said, at that time, primitive men—those men, who were still apes—did not know fire and lived in caves in the hills.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We have already said how man found fire.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now we will tell how he became a man.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  HOW HE BECAME A MAN
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In this newly born land of ours, humans lived (at least partially) in trees. Only in this way could they escape the great beasts. But the trees where they lived then were immensely larger than those we know today. With the fruit they found in them, they fed their children.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Another way of obtaining food was by extracting roots.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Over time, when humans became familiar with fire, they began to roast roots and fish. Since then, they have wandered nomadic along the banks of rivers and lakes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These men didn't live in one place; moreover, they didn't yet have established homes. They stayed wherever they found food, which is why no traces of their dwellings are known. They slept wherever night fell, so that at dawn they would return to their wanderings.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Over the course of thousands of years, he became human.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  LANGUAGE APPEARS
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  When man had this form of life, language emerged within him. What was the language of those men? What language did they speak? We'll talk about that:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The language of those men was simply shouting, an imitation of the cries of wild animals. That's why they couldn't talk to each other like we do.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But I must tell you, those screams the man emitted were different, whether they expressed joy or anger. As time passes, I can finally say something.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This first expression of their language is similar to the first babbling of children.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  And why couldn't the man speak?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Because their brains weren't sufficiently developed, they were similar to those of other animals. For this reason, they also lacked the ability to think and, consequently, to create language.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It took a long time for humans to learn language; their brains had a sufficient degree of development, and therefore a capacity for thought. At the same time, their vocal and auditory systems developed.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  HOW MEN LIVED
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We already said that men did not live in one place, and that they moved you from one place to another.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Just as wild animals move in search of food, primitive humans moved. They behaved like wild animals, even killing each other for the food they found.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It was during this period of their lives, when hunting peoples couldn't find a living, that cannibalism emerged. I must also tell you that this behavior wasn't considered a crime for them.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Even today, some primitive peoples still practice cannibalism. And it's possible that cannibals exist in the heart of our jungle.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Primitive humans lived in groups, similar to how troops of wild animals live.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  HOW THE FAMILY WAS FORMED
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The family is the foundation of the human community.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Since they lived in a naturally wild state, women belonged to many men and likewise men belonged to all women.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For this reason men reproduced like wild animals.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The women did not know whose children they were, just as the men did not know their children.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In the same way, the children did not know their parents, nor did they know their descendants.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  At this stage of human growth, monogamy was unknown, men had many wives, and women many husbands.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This is the fundamental reason why paternity was unknown.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This wild way of life also included incest, that is, sexual relations between parents and children.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Later, another form of relationship was adopted: group marriage.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I must tell you, nothing was quick and instantaneous; everything happened in stages. The formation of the family also followed this process of evolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  After many thousands of years, the primitive community moved to monogamy.
