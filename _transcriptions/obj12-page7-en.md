For me, at that time, he used to say to me, "this man has a good heart, since he starts writing like this." Some time later I read THE ADVENTURES OF CESAR VALLEJO IN PARIS through the pen of Ernesto More, he has walked along unnameable paths, when he was still young, a thirst for distant peoples consumed him, only he knows the song of his people in untold distances and also only he, with those eyes that are not mistaken, looks at the poor to speak on their behalf. YEARS AGO, THEY ASKED FOR THE QUECHUA When Ernesto More came to Parliament, representing his people, he spoke there about Quechua, he fought a war defending Quechua, we first asked him that in this way. HOW WAS THE WAR THAT UDA WROTE IN FAVOR —Those gentlemen who in Parliament only knew how to sleep, when they heard my request in favor of Quechua, laughed at me until they could not, but I was never ashamed, since that time I weigh in my heart the value of Quechua, and it ran in my blood, until now it continues to run, a limitless affection for Quechua. From behind his glasses he looks at me with his big eyes and suddenly he says this: —I entered into many battles, always in favor of Quechua, I defended it tirelessly, night and day I dreamed of Quechua, but I do not know how to speak, that is my great suffering, that fact I carry like a secret wound, with that I am saddened
  
  
  
  I know beyond suffering. THEY LOOKED AT HIM LIKE A MADMAN Ernesto More, together with 13 deputies in what we call Parliament, asked for Quechua to be made official at the level of Castilian, then the other deputies said: "These people are completely crazy," but just as the river walks among the roots, as it stretches out on the back of the stone, without fear of anything or anyone, so Ernesto More walked, laughing at those deputies with brains of ashes. Looking at him from moment to moment, I think of those years. Ernesto More speaks tirelessly, his conversation is without panting because he is full of knowledge, then this question comes to my mind. TELL ME IN WHICH BOOKS YOUR MOST RELIABLE THOUGHT IS AND WHICH OF HIS BOOKS YOU PREFER. BUT For a moment he looks up at the sky, like someone watching someone we all know coming, he grabs his chin, clearly thinking about what lights will flicker, then speaking slowly he tells us thus: —In my book REPORTS WITH RADAR you will find the progress of my thoughts, there I put gushes of my intelligence, all my thirst for battles, my eternal discontent, I wrote that book with all my worries, pursued by all my sorrows, sheltered by many falls, I also wrote jubilantly, my life is in those reports. THE MEN WHO KNOW THE MOST QUECHUA The fellow photographer works tirelessly, I ask myself where this thing they call technique will take us. Humberto Romaní, kneels, stands tall, pretends to lie down, he seems like a monkey to me, I want to laugh at what he does, but next to Ernesto More, I can't let out a laugh, more like throwing a stone, suddenly, I ask him this question: LIKE AN INTELLIGENT TEACHER, YOU SHOULD KNOW THE NAME OF WHAT YOU TRULY KNOW QUECHA - I don't have the science to answer that question, I don't speak Quechua clearly
  
  
  
  mind, glottalizing it, but walking on earth I met illustrious professors who knew and/or know Quechua. I'll start by telling you, in order of importance, their names. First, there's Oswaldo Baca Mendoza; he spoke sweetly, glottalized aesthetically, and it was then that, being a man of luminous heart, he was truly a good man, and for that reason, while still young, death took him. Then there's Víctor Navarro del Aguila; he too traveled the path of no return, when the people expected great achievements from him. Then there's José Félix Silva, who wrote under the pseudonym "Rumi ñawi." I did a report on him that appears in my book Reportajes con Radar. Then there's César Guardia Mayorga, Mariano Muñiz. I also knew Ibn Aharaon, he was a wise man, he knew Quechua profoundly, what paths he will now take, in what hollows he will lose himself, on what peaks he will rest, it has been many years since we last saw the wise Ibn Aharaon. I must say at this moment the name of José María Farfán, he in all his greatness lived in poverty, forgotten by all, cornered by all, insulted by men with tongues of fire. A QUESTION TO GO WITH It is never tiring to talk with Ernesto More, like a river of knowledge, like the root of a song, with his dazzling heart, he remembers many things, evokes names, the deeds of ancient poets. The trembling shudder of tyrants also remembers the joy of the people, knows everything, then I say: TO THE ONE WHO LOOKS WITH TRUE ADMIRATION Instantly and without thinking he says: To the wise Paul Rivet, he truly loved our people, not only the skin of Peru, he loved the heart of our homeland, he loved the Peru of the immortal entrails Then, like in the wayno we pour ourselves a drink in a small glass, already to leave, inside me, the tune of that song is written that says: "Let's toast with this little glass as we remember that we left."
