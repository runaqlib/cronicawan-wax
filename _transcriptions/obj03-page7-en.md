  **Thus spoke the members of the Quechua language academy**
  
  _Kaymi avademia of the Quechua language rimasrisqan_
  
  CRONICAWAN: What did you come to the city of Lima for?
  
  ARMANDO CACERES: I'll tell you why we've come. We've come to ask the following: It's been known since the Incas existed that the Quechua language spread from Cusco. Remembering that, the Quechua Language Academy has a House of Knowledge. We've been seeking for twenty years to have the truth of Quechua accepted as such.
  
  Here are the men who grew old seeking recognition for Quechua. Since Cusco is at the center, since Runasimi sprang from there so that everyone could speak it, we want to ask: That a house of knowledge be built in Cusco.
  
  The Academy is now in a borrowed house. We're in the Tourist Galleries, which belong to the Provincial Council. The Council is asking us to return that house. We live in that house, so we at CRONICAWAN appreciate this gesture.
  
  We've also come to ask if there's any way to get a grant for publishing books. As you know, we've translated the Spanish works into our Runasimi.
  
  Many of those here have already written and do not publish because they do not have money. Perhaps we will not even know what they have written.
  
  We asked this of the Minister of Education, and we also asked General Velasco Alvarado.
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN: Have you received money before?
  
  
  
  DELIA BLANCO FROM VALENCIA: Yes! They used to give us 10,000 soles. In 1959.
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN: Why was that grant lost? Who took it away from them?
  
  
  
  FAUSTINO ESPINOZA M. Little by little they reduced our salary from ten thousand soles to two thousand soles. They kept decreasing it, I don't know why.
  
  Year after year, we lost it. We didn't get the ten thousand soles consistently either; sometimes they gave us something, sometimes they didn't, until finally, they cut everything.
  
  Maybe they took it from us on purpose. I don't know what it's like. It's just diminishing, it's over.
  
  There are written documents for that money we received. There are papers.
  
  CRONICAWAN: How many years have they been giving you no money? How long has it been since you received a subsidy?
  
  DELIA BLANCO DE VALENCIA: They quietly removed us. At that time, Dr. Humberto Covarrubias was President of the Academy, and I was the Treasurer.
  
  To fix the house we had, we put in our money. Dr. Covarrubias put in five thousand soles and I put in seven thousand soles, that's all we got.
  
  Humberto Concha: Our brother Armando has already spoken clearly. I only have the following to add.
  
  There are documents about all of that. We haven't received anything else since then.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Our President should know that.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Let's talk about something else: What do they say about the formation of the High Level Commission?
  
  ARMANDO CACERES: Why does the one who rules in all of Peru, since he said there would be no more centralism, why has the Quechua been proceeded with a centralist criterion?
  
  Those who know, those who live in Lima or us know more; those of us in Cusco know more about runasimi. Those who live in the heart: They or us. The thing is, we don't sell our Quechua.
  
  
  
  We have come with our money Raising from what we work.
  
  But not even two people from the Academy have joined the Commission for that reason.
  
  
  
  CRONICAWAN: Didn't anyone hear them?
  
  At the Ministry. They made us walk through the entire Ministry. First, they made us go to see Colonel Artemio Palomino, Inspector General of Education. That same Colonel sent us to see Colonel Marlo Villavicencio, then we went to see Dr. Julio González. He then took us to Father Morales' office. He told us, "The Commission is already established. We will meet on Monday." That's what he told us.
  
  That Commission is Túpaq Yupanki. Engineer Pacheco, who was rector in Cusco, told us this about him: "He told us this is why you've come." Túpaq Yupanki has been around for a while now, he told us. "They've probably already chosen him, and with whom he'll work on all this, so you've come here out of pleasure."
  
  DELIA BLANCO DE VALENCIA: We've been working in Cusco for 20 years. They're still going to separate us.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Demetrio Túpaq Yupanki, who speaks Quechua like us, is from the Academy, isn't that true? Is that wrong?
  
  ARMANDO CACERES: Look. The Peruvian Academy of the Quechua Language is the mother. The mother of the language. The mother of the language is in Cusco.
  
  That's why the Lima Academy is like the youngest. It's the youngest, and it's called a branch.
  
  In that branch, this gentleman, no one knows how he became President. But why does this gentleman have the name President?
  
  Having done everything he had brought his companions there with joy, he had brought his students to be chosen.
  
  Once he took over the branch, this man did not satisfy the Academy's orders, but he was already working with an American gentleman, Zola, and he wrote as he should, I want a great book with how many thousands of thousands it would be, since he knows how to do business.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Can any of you say in writing why, as an Academic, you do not respect the Academy's record?
  
  Armando Cáceres: As we know, American imperialism has invaded everywhere, including the entire Peruvian people. We just worked as they wanted, but our government is slowly pushing them out. But that imperialism has invaded the Quechua language, with that Mr. Zolá, causing us to regress, causing us to make mistakes, making the Quechua language unclear, so we can't spell it correctly. Since it's not spelled correctly, they translate one thing for another, and they get bogged down. In ten years, the Quechua language will no longer exist.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Mr. Humberto Concha, as President of the Quechua Language Academy, what can you tell us?
  
  We've come to Crónica itself to speak with those who work here. We want to greet you and then praise what you've been doing. We praise you because you're making the language of Cusco known throughout the world. Yes, that's true, the true language. We say that those who work at CRONICAWAN are writing correctly.
  
  We have also come to this city of Lima to deliver our system of spellings to the Minister, so that all the committees can write correctly with the help of this system of spellings. With our alphabet so that they can write correctly.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Mr. Faustino Espinoza, I believe you want to talk. What do you say, Mr. Faustino?
  
  FAUSTINO ESPINOZA: Just as they've said. What my brothers say is true. That's how I'll help conclude this conversation.
  
  We have come to make this form of writing known to all of Peru. We have also come so that all of us who speak Quechua may always be united; we cannot live apart. We must be of one heart, one mind. By rising up, we must sweeten our Quechua language even further. We must make it mature even further.
  
  That's why we say "joyful." We'll send our thoughts to the CRONICAWAN newspaper. We'll send everything we do at the Academy.
  
  If the newspaper CRONICAWAN were divided or independent, we'd all have to work together on CRONICAWAN. We'd write to fill its pages. We could submit our writings on Mondays.
  
  CRONICAWAN: Since we've already talked about these things, now tell us how you received the CRONICAWAN newspaper. Just tell us the truth about our mistakes.
  
  ARMANDO CACERES: I was very happy to receive CRONICAWAN. Because it's written the way we write at the Academy, that's why. That style of writing should be followed throughout Peru.
  
  With these spellings they should write in Huancayo, Huaraz, Ayacucho their way of speaking.
  
  DELIA BLANCO DE VALENCIA: I received CRONICAWAN when I called Eric Escalante. He told me who was writing. That's why I was happy to have everyone look, that's how you communicate by telling them.
  
  FAUSTINO ESPINOZA: I received it with great joy. This has no seed from other sources saying it.
  
  As if my heart were bursting, I still looked at what you wrote. That's what others must do, saying it.
  
  That's why I said, "Let's help!" We're going to Lima. We'll always greet him, that's what I said. We'll help write. I said, "Let it look pristine." What's written in CRONICAWAN must be a Quechua pattern, so that when you look at CRONICAWAN, everything is written like that.
  
  HUMBERTO CONCHA: I am going to speak on behalf of the House where Quechua is taught.
  
  I was delighted to receive CRONICAWAN. Because it's written as it is. Because it's the best Quechua. These journalists, only by reading it, will understand the Quechua I said.
  
  And all the men who came to ask about us told us: These men who teach. In Quechua they told us: Proper names should be written as they are.
  
  CRONICAWAN: It will truly be until we meet again.
