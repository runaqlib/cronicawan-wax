  **SOWING IN THE HEART**
  
  
  
  Girls like me whom I don't know: Poets said in years gone by: "There are no roads, the roads stretch out as we walk." So it is, in all we do, with weariness and sweat even the trees rise, with effort and agony the stars flicker. In years gone by, they looked at us only as flowers, they looked at our beautiful dresses, well painted, but in our hearts only the winds of nothing dawned. In these days of revolution, we women, we girls, can no longer spend our days looking
  
  
  
  Our faces in the mirrors, we men must organize together to march alongside our people. We are living through years we will never forget. The people who come will talk about us, weigh our ways, or accuse us of the calm with which we live. Together, we men must work for our people. There is no joy for one person alone in the midst of a sea of ​​suffering. I will speak to you about these things from the pages of CRONICAWAN.
  
  
  
  With a single breath, with a bubbling heart, with a truthful hand. For you, on Tuesdays, I will add my ideas to this newspaper, so that we may walk on the right paths, speaking little, but rooting them in the truth. From now on, I want to be your sister; I want your beautiful spirit to reach my heart, so that a song may dawn in my womanly veins. For now, I will speak to you only. Zaida Bustamante. In the city of Lima, Tuesday, August, 1975.

  Rosa Alarco Larrabure, with profound ideals, a humanistic spirit, and recognized professional ability, has directed the Choir of the Universidad Mayor de San Marcos for fifteen years. She reminds CRONICAWAN that thirty years ago she graduated from the Conservatory of Music and from there went on to direct the first female school choir in Lima, with the students of the Rosa de Santa María School. After seven years of fruitful career, she was approached by a group of students from the Universidad de San Marcos who wished to create a choir. She joined them selflessly until, two years later, the university federation managed to integrate her into the teaching staff of that educational institution. This sensitive woman, full of a spring spirit that few achieve, is today dedicated to teaching music and, within that, to social outreach work.
  
  
  
  **THE SAN MARCOS CHOIR AND ITS SOCIAL PROJECTION**
  
  
  
  "The choir is an artistic expression that teaches, motivates people to express themselves, to work together and to work to please and serve others, encouraging the spirit of all who listen. It must always carry a social, human message in what it expresses."
  
  
  
  "singing," Rosa Alarco points out. "That's why," she added, "I believe a university choir should not only be exquisite, but should also teach everyone who wants to, as well as reach the majority of the population." This last is a standard of the San Marcos Choir, currently made up of a group of 50 members.
  
  
  
  **THE CHOIR FOR THE WORKERS**
  
  
  
  The San Marcos Choir, its director points out, can be described as a pioneer in extending its artistic work to working-class communities and larger populations. "You only have to request our presence through a letter submitted to the San Marcos Mansion in Parque Universitario, where we practice, so we can visit workplaces, communities, and towns." Since 1963, they have been performing every Saturday in young towns, unions, student groups, and workers who request it. Rosa Alarco also tells us that the choir has toured eleven departments in Chile and has performed at festivals in Chile and Ecuador, where it has always had a prominent presence.
  
  
  
  _Paymi ñawpachin nawraq takita llank'aqkunawan_kushachakuspa. (She encourages the Chorus by identifying herself with the workers.)
