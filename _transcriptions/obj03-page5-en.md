  **No one can be thrown out of their home anymore.**
  
  _Tomorrow pitapas wasinmanta qarqunqakuchu_
  
  The Revolutionary Government, in a demonstration of its pro-poor policy, taking the poor into account and looking out for them, has passed Law 21168. This law, bearing the approval and names of all the ministers, was published in the newspaper EL PERUANO on the 10th of this month.
  
  This law mandates that no tenant be evicted from the house in which they live, and that is why so-called "eviction trials" have ended.
  
  As we know, people who owned many houses would ask whatever price they wanted for a small room. The tenants were ordered around as if they were debtors. When the tenant didn't obey the orders, he was evicted from the house as if he were an animal. The guards, the clerks, the judges were all enemies of the tenant.
  
  Seeing these things, the Revolutionary Government has passed a law to stop eviction trials.
  
  However, for those who don't pay, for those who default, the eviction process still exists. Only those who default will be evicted.
  
  No longer will people suffer the ill will of their landlords; there will be no more abuse, no more sudden outbursts of anger from landlords, no more eviction lawsuits. Now they will truly live in peace, far from sorrow, without seeing the hateful faces of landlords.
  
  This law has been received with great joy by the people of the town.
  
  The people are seeing, they are grasping with their hands what the Revolutionary Government is doing for them. This law is truly for all people—for the people who are homeless. That's why the people of Peru all praise the Revolutionary Government. Putting their hands on their chests, they believe even more in the Government's banners.
  
  Just as the Government returned the land to those who work it, taking it out of the hands of the local bosses, so, raising its word to the heavens, it passed Law 21168, so that no one is ever thrown out of their homes like an animal.
  
  That's progress, and it's still a small step. The Revolutionary government has already announced it will enact the tenancy law. So that there will be enough housing for everyone, with justice. So that towns can expand, obeying just laws. So that the people of the town can live happily in them.
  
  The abolition of eviction trials has been something that has been demanded for years. It's a long road. Then the tenancy law will come. With that, the suffering of tenants will truly end forever. Houses didn't rise by themselves; they were built by the strength of poor people, by the sweat of the dispossessed, by the blood and suffering of the humble.
  
  With these things in mind, the government has said: Let there be houses for everyone. Everyone must live like men. Before, only those with money could afford a house. Only the rich lived like human beings.
  
  For all the Government does, we must help it even more. We must rise as one man when the Government calls us. We must advance as one heart along the paths where the Government walks.
  
  
  
  
  
  **With the purest marble we must raise the monument to Tupac Amaru**
  
  **_Paraqay sansaq rumipi Tupaq Amaru Wankinta Hatarichinanchis_** **
  
  The name of Túpac Amaru stirred our hearts. From his ashes, Túpac Amaru returns to us. We are reaping the harvest for him these days. We speak of him as a man every day, yet we do not raise a memorial to him with the purest of marble.
  
  That's being forgetful. It's having a bad memory. What kind of people are we? Or are we a people of charlatans? Isn't the name of Túpac Amaru in our hearts? Why do we speak only his name, without recognizing and praising his spirit?
  
  In the past, almost twenty years ago, we had to raise the name of Túpac Amaru in the Plaza of Cusco. Stone by stone, we had to raise it, but we forgot about it between words, insulting each other, arguing among ourselves, walking badly and barely, without getting anywhere.
  
  And the Spanish supporters, clutching their books, say: "Tupac Amaru cannot rise in this plaza (of Cusco). In the Plaza of Cusco are the houses of God, there are temples, very beautiful buildings. Tupac Amaru cannot be there," they say.
  
  We're already growing old, speaking of Túpac Amaru from one moment to another. The years are passing by, laden with words. Just talking, we're doing nothing. At once, speaking with one voice, we must implore our General Juan Velasco Alvarado to order that a monument to Túpac Amaru be erected in the purest marble in the Plaza of Cusco. Why? For these reasons:
  
  In Cusco's Plaza de Armas, the Spanish murdered Túpac Amaru's entire family. There, Túpac Amaru was bound hand and foot to four beasts, and there the Spaniards tried to dismember him. There, our mother, Micaela Bastidas, saw all her children die. There, they incinerated Túpac Amaru's body; there, his gaze was turned to ashes by those soulless Spaniards.
  
  Who came first to this land, us or those who built the churches? How can the Tupac Amaru monument disfigure that sacred place? Where did the Spanish-speaking people get the idea that the Tupac Amaru monument is out of place in Cusco Plaza? Or are they just repeating what the local bosses say?
  
  All the hearts of the people must rise up. All the poor of Peru must shout. We must shout the name of Túpac Amaru again until his monument is erected in the Plaza de Armas of Cusco.
  
  The Spanish-minded of these days want to kill Túpac Amaru again. They fear Túpac Amaru's soul. Túpac Amaru can walk again, they say. He can defeat all men with ruthless hearts. Túpac Amaru can be resurrected, they say.
  
  We are living a Revolution, it is more than impossible for the Spanish to defeat us, we Peruvians will raise the monument to Túpac Amaru in the Plaza de Armas of Cusco. We will raise a monument to Túpac Amaru in the best of moles so that he may live for all eternity. From the Plaza de Armas of Cusco, Túpac Amaru will watch over our steps, he will carry the flag of his people who walk.
  
  **Master Mariátegui**
  
  _Mariátegui: Hamawt'a_
  
  To speak of the Amauta, we must expand our language more clearly. A single thought must crystallize in our minds.
  
  But who is the Amauta? Who could he have been? Who was he? For us to speak of him like this, rising to the height of heaven. Was he a man, a thinker, or was he the one who commands all the generals in wars?
  
  All of these things was the master José Carlos Mariátegui. He showed us the path our people must follow, and he himself, with his word, enlightens us. He is the same one who showed the path to the blind, to the immature. He dawns on the paths we must reach; his deep footprints are already bringing us closer to the truth. Only his footsteps must we follow if we wish to advance.
  
  Through it, men who work are seen as men, and the people walk with the true people.
  
  Mariátegui's house is in the hands of other men. In that house the teacher lived, In that house he wrote everything he knew so that we could learn.
  
  
  
  
  
  For these reasons, New Peru joyfully returns to Mariátegui, once again seeking his knowledge. For this reason, money is being raised to purchase the House of Mariátegui. So that, as before, that house may guard the knowledge of José Carlos Mariategui. So that every time the shadow of ignorance covers our eyes, we may raise our eyes and enter that house, to mature our minds under its eaves.
  
  Why should we buy the Master's house?
  
  The memory of the best children, the wisest, cannot be lost in the distance of time.
  
  Now those forgotten men will pour all their knowledge into our hearts, and the memory they left behind in the streets will once again walk in our hands; their hands will once again write.
  
  Because we will achieve all this, we must buy the House of Mariátegui So that it may bring joy from afar to the one who has passed away, so that it may return before its own death.
  
  We must help, because all help is just a loan.
  
  
  
  
  
  **Secret Chronicle**
  
  _Pakasqa Qelqa_
  
  WITHOUT TRUCE AT ALL HOURS
  
  I know many illnesses that dry up the marrow, paint absences on faces, or mercilessly wither the flesh. Ferocious illnesses, invulnerable to all medicines. They are maladies slower than death, requiring scars, secrecy, and collapse.
  
  When one of these evil ones extends his death ceremonies into the life of an acquaintance, a silence deeper than the night consecrates him with premature farewells. The healthy surround the sick with looks of compassion, their friends become close, and the condemned man has nothing but virtues. It's like returning from an early funeral talking about the deeds of the deceased. Incurable illnesses have the palliative of the Last Days.
  
  It's quite another thing not to be sick, not to have a circle of friends, to walk from home to work and back in a fierce fog. To live haunted by the fog, crowned by its sad spell of dark memories. Not to be sick, but to waste away in the fog, is worse than being dead.
  
  Only the fog has a drum of memories that shortens distances, it has a calendar of scales, a taste of thistles and sour lemons, that the fog resembles a coffin without contours, it is a cry of secret kestrels pecking at the heart without pause.
  
  No coffee, no noise, no alcohol can defeat the fog's patience of naked humidity, its name of ferns, and its gentleness of rain and silence makes it even darker, more respectable than sadness itself. The fog is a trisagion that oscillates like a cross, a path to death that doubles the reasons for death. Only the fog awakens seamlessly like a transparent tombstone, a glow of shadows and evil hallways, a drifting dream summoning defeats.
  
  Nothing diminishes in the midst of the fog, on the contrary, sorrows become more embittered, the will is fearful, there is no desire to even accommodate oneself in the world, the struggle for life is a face clouded by a grim mirror, the city itself is blurred, memories fall like sullen birds and I don't know in whose pockets the bows of childhood become more miserable.
  
  Personally, I would like to be optimistic, walk quickly, always be smiling, but with so much fog, nothing is possible, bitter with myself, I don't know where to look, nor who to tell about a dark wound that has been bubbling up for a long time, because every time I look out the window of the house where I always stay, the fog decrees sunsets in me before their time, however... good morning, gentlemen, here I am, I reiterate, my vocation as a slave has no end. ALMOST PERIOD.
  
  
  
  
  
  **Quechua Triumph**
  
  _Haycha, Runasimi_
  
  The day has finally arrived when we can feel proud of the language our teachers created yesterday.
  
  That's why I say to the thousands of fellow countrymen who, like me, speak Quechua; today our hearts overflow with immense joy: because Quechua, along with Spanish, are official languages.
  
  To them I say, wherever you are and with whomever you are, speak without humiliation, holding your heads high, with a strong voice, so that all men may hear.
  
  
  
  
  
  We've always waited for a day like today to come and we've waited to find ourselves.
  
  This language has stopped growing for five hundred years. Those who broke its divine stature have been unable to kill it.
  
  They first took away our people's freedom, then they took away their speech.
  
  I want to end by saying what Fernando Cabieses Molina said: “The word of man is the word of the soul.”
