  shan, huchiypas hatunpas, mit'alipas, nisqapas magazine. THEY ARE DISPLAYING BOOKS WRITTEN IN QUECHUA. It is not only in these times that people write in Quechua. In previous years, intelligent priests with vast thoughts spoke Quechua, so that the heart of Jesus Christ would spread. In Quechua, they reached the soul of the people, in the name of the powerful Maker of the Earth. It was also in Quechua, with lavish language, with flowery speech, that they alluded to the celestial children of God. They wrote all these things to teach each other. They named them: devotionals, sermons, prayers, mysteries, with all kinds of names. They kept these things for years past, in the houses of books called libraries in Spanish. Truly, they had kept huge quantities of books, so as to never make mistakes. That, the National Institute of Culture, has put before the eyes of the people As if from his death he were still looking at us, so our teacher: Inca Garcilaso de la Vega y Chimpuocllo, from a painting is looking, all the books, all the visitors, all the letters There they are: "Confessio
  
  
  
  Narrative and Christian Doctrine" which was written in 1560 by the priest Domingo de Santo Tomás. There is what JM Farfán thought, Fernando de Avendaño had also written a book, you can see all kinds of writings, small, large, newspapers and the so-called magazines.

  THE WIND What could the wind's wings have been for? What could the wind have been for, with its multitude of eyes, if it didn't take away sorrow, if it didn't see what can no longer be seen. Only the wind makes us know that we are made of earth, only the wind makes us dream that we are a river. Only the wind swallows all our certainties with its greatness, and it is also the wind that turns our journeys into nothing. The wind carries money in its hands; it assesses the price of men with those hands. It buries everyone with its leaden breath, as if it were the shadow of God, the wind knows everything. It lavishes all that is just, cornerstone, cornerstone, the wind is not to be forgotten; it makes the living fly; it implores the dead with its pristine walk and with its blinded march. What doesn't the wind know? knows the souls of rulers, sees tears in the eyes of soldiers who have the ferocity of pumas, receives the tiredness of men, hears the breath of the dead (what things does the wind still not know? What no one has seen the wind looks at with its large taruka eyes, what no one knows, like a thoughtful God the wind knows. What no one speaks, the wind discourses, what no one has traveled the wind walks. Next to the window of my house the wind awaits me. Like a sentinel the wind awaits me, like a bridge that cannot be crossed the wind looks at me, like a town I will never know the wind calls me. Why does the wind follow me so much, why does the wind call me so much?
