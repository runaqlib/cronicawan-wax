(For CRONICAWAN).-In the city of Bogotá the representatives of Colombia and Ecuador spoke, so that both peoples extend their rights up to two hundred miles. What is this about the two hundred miles of territorial sea that we talk about?
  
  
  
  As we know, the sea extends in every direction. That sea breeds all kinds of fish, and that is the source of wealth for the people. And since we are a poor people, foreigners come to fish, and they take that fish back to their villages, leaving nothing for the people whose fish they took. For that reason, the people of Peru have said: It is not right for foreigners to take away our people without leaving anything. We must pay attention to that, so that our sea does not become impoverished. That is what the people of Peru said back in 1948. For that reason, many people confirm the truth spoken by the people of Peru. The defense of the 200 nautical miles is strengthened, but it has been further invigorated with the accession of Colombia.

  BANGLADESH, August 1975. (For CRONICAWANJ.— In Bangladesh, on the Asian continent, on the 14th, the military rose up to vote for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was governing the country. He was ousted, but the Sheikh did not want to leave, offering resistance, going into battle. In that battle, Sheikh Mujibur died, and along with him, his sister and two of his nephews were killed. For that reason, the people who loved Sheikh Mujibur offered battle to the soldiers, and two hundred people died in those events. Now the new ruler, the one who has risen up, is headed by Mr. Khondakhar Muchtaque Ahmed, and he is choosing who he will work with. But until now, what we call the airport, as well as what we know as the telephone and telegraph, are still not working. For that reason, the truth is not known, what is happening, or how they are living.

GENERAL MORALES BERMUDEZ RETURNED FROM BOLIVIA General Francisco Morales Bermúdez has returned from the Bolivian nation. Speaking there, with the blood of his heart, with his spirit rooted in America, truly thinking, he has buried the voices that speak of hate, he has put the name of our people in a great place, so that Chile, Bolivia, and Peru do not wake up in war. General Morales Bermú has brought us peace
  
  
  
  Harmony among the peoples of America has achieved peace with sincerity, without hiding anything, speaking only the truth. Those who formerly exploited the people of Peru, with their foreign spirit, want to defeat our people, seeking to stop the Revolution. That is why they dream of wars, they want to push us, the peoples of America, onto a path of blood. That timid and fearful march, suddenly, with a man's voice, with a voice that cannot lie, General Francisco Morales Bermudez has been arrested.
