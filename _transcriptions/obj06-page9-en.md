  **MAST'ARIKUCHUN TARWI TARPUY.**
  
  _THAT IT IS ENCOURAGED_THE CULTIVATION OF TARWI
  
  Tarwi is a leguminous plant native to the Tawantinsuyu, known by the scientific name of Lupinus mutabilis. It is a seed similar to lentils, constituting this legume as a great source of protein. It is abundant in the high mountain ranges of Peru, since ancient times; it is the one that the population of the Inca Empire cultivated this seed in frigid and frozen regions of the land, providing a food product for the entire Andean population, from then on Subsisting to date as a food product among the Andean inhabitants of our country. Tarwi grows in fertile soils, even dispensing with abandoned lands. We can also note that this group is superior in protein to soy, which does provide economic incentives for the propagation of its cultivation. The protein indices of these two legumes are the following: Soy, with 40% protein and 20% oil. Tarwi, with 55% protein and 25% celte. As this comparison of the experimental results carried out at the Experimental Centers shows, tarwi is a legume rich in protein and lipids. Therefore, it has truly been proven that it could cover the lack of protein and oil that is so scarce in our environment, thereby improving the protein level of the child population throughout our country. Therefore, we believe that the Ministries of Food and Agriculture should undertake a crusade to spread its cultivation and, consequently, its industrialization for human consumption.
