  _THE IRON IS OURS_
  
  The rescue of our natural resources is one of the primary tasks imposed by the Peruvian Revolution. A task consistent not only with the urgent need to command and decide over what is ours, which entails the full exercise of national sovereignty and dignity, but also because such a policy responds to the Third World imperative to confront the unholy dealings of transnational corporations that are the cause of the underdevelopment our peoples are struggling with.
  
  For industrialized nations, as Minister Fernández Maldonado recently stated, iron constitutes the basis for the development of their respective steel industries, whose role in the historical development of their economies, and, in general, in the development of any economy, is widely known. Peru is primarily interested, therefore, in producing steel. But Marcona Mining Co. didn't see it that way. It wasn't interested in understanding it that way. As part of a transnational and imperialist system, it couldn't serve Peru or Peru's interests, but rather served interests completely alien to our own. That's why it prostrated the national steel industry, selling, for example, products of inferior quality to those shipped abroad. The nationalization of Marcona was inevitable and necessary for the country's interests. The Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces couldn't compromise on such an imperative, also contemplated in the Inca Plan. And Marcona was nationalized in the most appropriate manner and under the most appropriate terms. In the manner and terms that demonstrate the justice of a cause that no one can dispute or object to today's Peru or its rulers. The treatment the aforementioned company has received while operating in the country has been extensively generous. Perhaps excessively generous. However, despite this, it has not hesitated to launch an insidious campaign of lies and threats against Peru, with the clear purpose of damaging our country's image and economy in the eyes of the world. It has embarked on a campaign of sabotage aimed at preventing the purchase of Peruvian iron ore abroad. And to achieve this, it is utilizing an entire international machinery, which has the clear support of foreign media outlets at the service of the Inter-American Press Association. But the Peruvian Revolution has and always will have a response to every imperialist aggression. It will never back down in the face of any threat or maneuver aimed at harming the homeland or intimidating the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces. The Peruvian Revolution is cured of fear. It has emerged victorious in every battle it has fought against every form of imperialist aggression. And it won't be Marcona Mining Co. that will make us waver. Because, ultimately, the imperatives of dignity and the defense of our sovereignty are the best incentives for a revolutionary people and government determined to break all the chains of dependence.

  _WOMEN'S LIBERATION_
  
  In communities like ours, plagued by centuries of febrile injustice. Among populations accustomed to silence, to the cries of impotence, to defeat, and silence, no liberation can be understood outside of economic domination. The subjugation of women to the decisions of men stems from the fact that men are the ones who provide sufficient capital to maintain the household. Hence the importance that even the Civil Code grants to men within the hierarchy of authority that prevails in the home. It is not without reason that the marginalization of women arose as a direct result of men's economic power within primitive social organizations. The patriarchal family is nothing more than the will of the male owner of estates and lives, extending not only to slaves but even to his own, in an uncontrolled and ruthless power. Subsequently, to justify this economic structure, legends and myths were woven, denying women all initiative and ability—even intellectual—making science, sports, and certain activities the preserve of men, exclusive activities of the so-called stronger sex, a definition that is a blatant expression of machismo. In our time, such baseless and arbitrary concepts have been refuted in practice by the triumph of women in every activity they have undertaken, and in theory, by being sophistries without scientific veracity. Women are just as capable as men to undertake any kind of activity in any field or stratum of human endeavor. But both men and women are convinced that in dependent, underdeveloped, extractive-industry countries, women's liberation presupposes the economic liberation of the people. There will be no prior recognition of women's rights unless the shackles of underdevelopment and the marginalization of Third World peoples are broken. It is headed toward definitive and total liberation at all levels, in both structures and superstructures. It is aimed at a change in the relations of production and in all aspects of social life. Women's liberation as a questioning of a sexist society, or as a confrontation with men, makes no sense and cannot be explained with common sense. Women's liberation entails the liberation of the entire social organization. It is a just and noble struggle of men and women to achieve standards of living compatible with human dignity. Only with this sense and with this criterion can the feminist liberation movement be understood.

  _THE GLORY OF JUNIN_
  
  The victory at Junín—that is, the defeat inflicted by the patriotic troops on the royalist army—had a great influence on the fate of Peru and the continent. It was not, as the Spaniard Torrente would say, the loss of four hundred cavalry suffered by the royalists "the most sensitive aspect for the zealous general who commanded them, but the distrust that crept in upon them since they saw such serenity and firmness in their ranks." That same author, who a few months earlier had written that the state of public affairs was extremely flattering for the royalists at the end of 1823, that since the battle at Ica they had run "a race of triumphs and glories," and that the enemy (the patriots) had been beaten every time they had had the composure to confront them. After Junín, he had to acknowledge that if the royalists had won that battle, they would have formed "the first link in a chain of triumphs," but that they lost "and formed a chain of contrasts and setbacks." The victory at Junín was thus of decisive importance to American Independence, although Canterac's infantry and cavalry escaped the annihilating battle that Bolívar sought in that very arena. But months later, it would be Quinua, in Ayacucho, that would become the graveyard of royalist ambitions, the burial ground of the Crown's desires for domination. 151 years ago, on a day like today, the Junín Hussars rose to glory and left subsequent generations a sublime example of courage, determination, and love of liberty and dignity that knows no compromise with any form of dependence or domination. Heirs of the Glorious Hussars of Junín Regiment, heirs of Castilla, Gamarra and Rázuri, heirs of La Mar, Necochea, Miller and Suárez, the men who today form the cavalry regiments of our Armed Forces know very well that the ideas of justice, the demand for justice, the affirmation of justice in Peruvian life are, as a renowned historian would say, the great themes in the ideological portrait of the precursor man. It is justice for which the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces is fighting today: taking up the flags of Tinta, Junín, Ayacucho and Callao del 2 de Mayo. That is, justice for the rural man, justice for the urban worker, justice for the eternally marginalized, the justice demanded of public officials, the justice demanded by legal norms, the justice that demands for us the right to be the builders of our own destiny, the justice that rejects the use of force, the justice that rejects, in short, all forms of exploitation, all forms of dependency. Today, for each and every Peruvian, for each and every Latin American man, for each and every Cavalry man, it must therefore be,day of meditation and repeated fidelity to the ideals that generated the glory of Junin.
  
  12/8 The poor do not live forever defeated. No one is defeated forever if they are not buried. There are unknown hands on earth, eyes we will never look upon, hearts we will never guess, that truly and silently help the needy. But we cannot live thinking only of the good hearts of men. In truth, men of ability and intelligence must unite among themselves, they must strengthen themselves by helping one another. Just as the strength of trees lies in the roots, in the same way, the strength of the poor only awakens in the solidarity of other poor people; it grows and multiplies with unremitting suffering. We, the poor, must meditate on this, only among the poor, reaching out among peasants, grasping our flags with the fists of men. The hen and the fox will not live in harmony, nor will the cat and the mouse sip porridge from a plate. Our General Velasco Alvarado has already explained this to us. Let us walk among the men of the people, strengthening ourselves in the people; united among the poor we will certainly walk very far.

  THE ROADS
  
  Roads exist to unite distances. They are the material forms of oblivion, stretching tirelessly across horizons, rising above peaks, lying in the savannahs, sinking into valleys, dreaming of nothing but absences. Roads persist, unchanged from others. who does not dream of roads when the day is dying" who does not remember paths, bridges already crossed" who does not live roads while life goes onP The poet already said: Traveler, there are no roads, the road is made by walking". There are unforgettable roads like those that lead back home, rough roads, full of grudges, bitter, the roads of foreign meals, of borrowed beds, the roads of the sad sandbanks of other homelands. Those are the roads of death, which do not separate; but unite in direct proportion to the distance, like the Platonic myth, the persistences are clearer when the shadow is greater in the cave. There are countless writers who have taken roads as their theme, Gorky, titles one of his books of memoirs with the noun: THE ROADS. Perhaps because nothing is as infuriating as leaving by force, moving away, not stopping even to see from the mountain the town that can no longer be, or to look from memory at the time that no longer may rise up and I simply because walking is to uproot oneself from the earth and put down roots in the air, when human beings should have been like trees, nourished by the water and the earth that fed their first wonders: But man is not a river, he is like a road that is made into absence by force, exile and solitude step by step. Ah, the roads, who could be like them, ubiquitous, intricate and difficult, without a heart anywhere, without sunshine, or chants without an undertow of remorse. Only the roads know and do not know because they ignore all returns and know all absences. PERIOD.
