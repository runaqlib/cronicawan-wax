  _THE TIAR WILL BE RENOVATED_
  
  SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, July 1975 (Pana CRONICAWAN). - The city of San José is the capital of Costa Rica (Costa Rica is located in Central America, has an area of ​​50,900 square kilometers and a population of 2 million). Representatives of all the countries of the Americas (these representatives are called ambassadors) will meet in that city to discuss changes to be introduced to the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Action (TIAR). The TIAR was signed in 1946 as a defense mechanism for the countries of the Americas against any external aggression. The treaty was signed in that spirit. However, this was not the case. The United States, due to its power, has manipulated this organization according to its own interests. However, the other countries of the continent have now agreed to reform the TIAR (Argentine Inter-American Treaty on the Restructuring of the Americas), so that it is not open to manipulation by any country and reflects the interests of the poorest countries in the Americas. To this end, they will meet in San José in the coming days. One of the first countries to call for this reform has been Peru.

  _THEY SEEK TO ACHIEVE PEACE_
  
  WASHINGTON, July 1975 (CRONICAWAN).-- In Washington, D.C., on the 8th of this month, it was announced that Israeli Prime Minister Yitnak Rabin and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will meet in the coming days. At this meeting, they will discuss matters relating to Middle East peace, in order to avoid another war between the Arab countries and Israel. Peace in this region has been eagerly awaited for a long time, but to date, it has not been achieved. Now, with these talks, the possibility of achieving peace opens up again. If the Israeli government agrees to vacate the Arab territories it currently occupies, the Egyptian leaders would be willing to reach an agreement. However, the difficulty lies in Israel's refusal to hand over these territories to the Egyptians; instead, it hopes that they will be declared a "neutral zone." The progress made in these meetings will partly determine whether they will face a new war or find peace.

  **OMAR TORRIJOS met with young people.**
  
  PANAMA, July 1975 (For CRONICAWAN). - Governor Omar Torrijos, President of Panama, convened 300 student leaders to inform them about the current state of the
  
  of the talks with the U.S. to achieve the return of the Canal. This meeting was attended by student leaders of all political persuasions, and General Torrijos stated that he would keep the Panamanian people informed of all the steps taken in the talks with the U.S. government. Omar Torrijos added, "We were wrong not to report on the progress of the talks. But we will rectify this mistake after this conversation with you." General Torrijos informed the students about the difficulties that arose during the talks, especially regarding the duration of the new treaty, as well as the use of land and water. He also reported on the refusal of the U.S. government to withdraw its troops from the canal area and to relocate existing U.S. military bases. This position differs from the Panamanian position, which demands the withdrawal of troops and the immediate relocation of Yankee military bases.
