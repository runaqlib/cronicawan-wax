  **OF MEN WITH TWO TRUTHS**
  
  
  
  I've seen people around the world flattering themselves by claiming they only speak the truth; among themselves, they say, "We only love the truth." In their idle chatter, they truly talk about their idleness, as if they were scientists. They speak of pre-cooked thoughts, which is what the mestizos call "commonplaces." Of course, they only ponder among themselves, they defend themselves.
  
  
  
  Just as they talk trivialities, they waste their days reminiscing about their parties, talking about their revelry, they defend what they call their business, but, satiated, they insult tirelessly, they hate without compassion if anyone dares to speak of them. These men don't love the truth, they love their fatness, they only love their money. Above all else, they want their fortune, what they call the truth; they crave it like a garment, to wrap their shame, their impurities. Deep down, they are all personalists; they associate with no one, they only live in collusion with their money. These men will be finished off with the march of the Revolution.

  **A REVOLUTION WILL BE MADE BY INCREASING PRODUCTION**
  
  
  
  We will not build the Revolution by talking alone, nor by working in any way, nor with peripheral displays. We will not build our people by working without will. With firm steps, we will unleash the revolution upon the heads of our people like a halo of happiness, as if we were lighting an inextinguishable fire. In this way, the Revolution is made by all men with their strength, by the people with their multitudinous accent. The Revolution only spreads through work; it is built like a wall of peace, with the mortar of sweat, blood, and tears. There will be no true song, nor joy, nor jubilation if we do not achieve the fullness of the revolution. Only in the Revolution does the spirit of the people grow, only in the revolution do the songs of the people blossom, only the Revolution decrees the extinction of suffering. Just as our Apu Tupac Amaru, as Micaela Bastidas and her family suffered the unspeakable at the hands of the Spanish searching for the flags of the people, just as they returned from their seeds searching for the flags of the people, just as they live in our hearts because they fought for the cause of the people, just as Túpas Amaru and Micaela Bastidas dawn in our chests every day, in that same way every day we must continue their paths, we must work for our people, we must follow Túpac Amaru, since we found a people with freedom, let us leave another, where the song is the heritage of all. It is in our hands the possibility that the earth bears more fruit, in our hands rests the breath of the fruits, even the dream of the quinoa in our hands tasca, we must work even harder so that the pineapples multiply, so that the potatoes, the corn, the custard apples, the sweet potatoes bear fruit, that there be fruits and fruits for all.
