HAMLET "Hamlet" is succeeded by his own. He knows who killed his father, he knows the murderer (Claudius King of Denmark), but what does he do, he simply immerses himself in a world of reflections: I act or I did not act, I kill him or I do not kill him, if I kill him why do I kill him... in short, every lucubration and every excuse that indefinitely postpones the definitive action... until the inevitable happens: the foreign invader (Fortimbras, Prince of Norway), arrives and takes over power. What may well appear to be a far-fetched thing is not such. This is how Shakespeare wrote it and how it is presented by the National Popular Theater, under the direction of Alonso Alegría, who on the opening night told the audience: "Hamlet" is a production that has been performed by two people: Clara Izurieta, assistant director, and me. Many people who attend the presentations of "Hamlet" expect to see a "political" production as some publications had announced, but they found themselves with a production that revolves around the famous dilemma: "to be or not be"... However, there were many people who thought they would see something else", as if that were not enough...)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The National Popular Theater has staged "Hamlet" with a demystifying premise: which can be illustrated in the phrase that Alonso Alegría quotes "the ancients were not "the ancients" for the ancients." Precisely Alonso Alegría, in the hand program. points out that in the same way and with greater seasoning, we should not allow the classics to become "the classics." "It is essential to always put in full theatrical validity the traditional definition of a classic work that is relevant at all times and through time." When we proposed the editing of "Hamlet," says Alonso Alegria, always citing the same source, we tried to avoid two traps. On the one hand, the genuflexa: idolization of the author: Shakespeare, like a superhuman genius incapable of forgetting a detail, making a bad joke or swearing, who must be obeyed, step by step, in the montage without daring to cut a line of the text, nor
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  interpret their thoughts by recreating them on stage with the legitimate means of the Theatre. Such an attitude - Alegria points out - leads, inevitably, to the "classical" montage of the classic: a montage that reflects so much "respect" for the ancient author that its proclaimed "eternal validity" is nowhere to be seen. And we look at the montage with the same interest with which we go to a museum.

  **THE RIVERS (II)**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Like a dream that will never come true, the rivers travel their own paths, as if the eyes of the wind were falling on their shoulders, in this way, the rivers run tirelessly along channels without errors. The rivers cry in the being of water. What no one forgets is lost silently in the rivers. Always a reef, the rivers pour out the sorrows, giant veins, the wounds that the heart cannot carry away, without asking anyone, without murmuring to anyone, losing themselves in themselves. The reverberations of the mother moon on earth match the rivers to leave. In the secret of the night, when the clay is still a project of grass, even when the prosperity of the ice still lies in the condition of crying, when even sleep is the image of death, the rivers dialogue among themselves, as if the non-being of oblivion argued with itself, sleepwalking in their own hypnotism, the rivers shout their condition as rivers. In the sea the rivers become disoriented, like the dead that we lose on earth when we bury them, in the same way, the rivers by themselves become white in the foam of the banks, empty spaces become, transfigured in the spirit of water. The rivers know reliable paths, they guess unclimbable peaks, when walking they unleash dark contingencies, they weigh themselves, with being water, the rivers are definitive in their absences and they defend themselves by emigrating tirelessly. Rivers teach us the forms of absence.
