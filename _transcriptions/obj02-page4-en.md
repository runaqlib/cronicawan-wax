  _SOVIET UNION LLAQTAMANTA_PACHA.
  
  MOSCOW, June 5 (PL).- The Soviet Union's daily "Pravda" reports on the Decree Law that makes Runasimi official, as follows: Runasimi and Spanish have been declared official languages ​​of Peru. With this measure, the Peruvian people will more quickly find the path to national unity.
  
  In the name of the people and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the newspaper adds, "The Revolutionary Government of Peru liberates and uplifts the Runasimi language, which for so long had been prostrated and discriminated against." The Peruvian oligarchy sought to eradicate this language, which has been spoken by Peruvians for many years. Pravda adds, "In Peru, 60 out of every 100 people speak Runasimi. This law will help uplift many peasants and will greatly contribute to Peru's economic and social development."

  GUATEMALA. -- Central America. -- June 5, 1975 (For LA CRONICA).- Once again, Guatemala is demanding the return of Belize and asserting its rights. Belize is a territorial strip that extends across 22,965 square kilometers. Remains of buildings constructed by the ancient Mayan culture still stand there. This territory is currently in the possession of Great Britain, also known as England. The country of Guatemala extends into what is known as Central America; it is an area of ​​plains and mountains, quite far from our country. This country of Guatemala demands that Belize be returned to it by Great Britain and that the English abandon this territory. However, the British government does not wish to return this territory to Guatemala; instead, it wishes to unilaterally grant it independence. But in the near future, it will be the Belizeans alone who will decide their destiny. So they will say tomorrow: Let us, among Belizeans, decide our destiny in peace and harmony.

  BRASILIA BRAZIL (June 4, 1975 (FOR LA CRONICA) - Brasilia is the capital of the country called Brazil. The rulers of that country have made it known that they can build the atomic bomb. This atomic bomb can kill men by burning them to a crisp; in its explosions it sows death. The first to explode this bomb were the United States, in Japan, producing almost a million deaths. All the countries of Latin America have shown concern over this announcement by the rulers of Brazil, since if the announcement were true, peace and tranquility in our countries would disappear. In addition, other countries would have to spend a lot of money, since manufacturing the atomic bomb costs a lot. That is not right; we want that money to be used to build work centers, so that we can live better. 100 million people live in Brazil, over an area of ​​8,500,000 square kilometers. Brazil is located in this same South America, and borders us to the east.

  **VENEZUELA LLAQTA PETROLLUNTA**CHASKIKAPUNQA**
  
  _VENEZUELA WILL NATIONALIZE_YOUR OIL
  
  VENEZUELA, June 5 (For La Cronica.) Venezuela is a country with 10,400,000 inhabitants. Today, this country is restless because they want to receive its oil from foreign hands. This nation's oil has been in the hands of North American companies for fifty years now. This oil is known as "black gold" and is highly sought after by men throughout the world. That's why Venezuela wants to receive its oil from the foreign hands that own it. If they nationalize it and receive it, then their money will increase even more. But, to nationalize their oil, they have to walk a difficult path, given the opposition of those in power with money. Added to this is the fact that within Venezuela itself, there are those who oppose nationalization. There are also those in Venezuela who want to nationalize the oil immediately, and then we will celebrate a free Venezuela, they say. So far, we only know that Venezuela will receive its oil at the end of this year.
  
  UNITED STATES KAMACHIKUQ WANINK'AN POPE PAUL VI CHASKIN
  
  PAUL VI RECEIVES THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.
  
  ROME, Italy, June 4, 1975 (For La Crónica). Rome is the capital city of Italy, where the headquarters of the Catholic Church resides, and where the head of the Church, Pope Paul VI, resides. Upon receiving the President of the United States, the Pope reminded him that "There will be no peace on the face of the earth if it is to be built on the basis of force and money," as Pope Paul VI warned. Imperialism, because it has money and is powerful, believes that force can establish world peace, but that is not true. Weapons and money only contribute to dividing people. Pope Paul VI continued, "I raise my voice to remind everyone that international peace cannot be based on power, but on the criteria of justice, understanding, and goodwill, on harmony and cooperation between the strongest and the weakest."
