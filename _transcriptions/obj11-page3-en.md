  _THE PERUVIAN WOMAN ALWAYS_HE HAD A LIBERATING ROLE.
  
  BY: PERLA BACA
  
  Gestating our national history, from the formation of its historical past to the present day, the work and action of Peruvian women has been liberating in many cases, but forgotten by our history. If we remember the past we can see that at the beginning of the Inca Empire it was Mama Ocllo who collaborated with Manco Capac in the formation of the Empire and then Chañan Curicosa who fought against the Huanca and Hualla tribes, who fled to the jungle, thus helping the troops of Inca Ripac in the consolidation of the
  
  nascent empire. During the conquest, women like Curi Ocllo and Huran Nusta died fighting against Gonzalo Pizarro's troops. During the time of the conquest, I remember that it was a woman, Inés de Muñoz, who changed the eating system from corn bread to wheat bread by bringing a bushel (an instrument for measuring cereals) of this cereal from Spain. During the Colonial period, women adapted their behavior to the needs of their times, and thus hundreds of women put their wealth at the service of educational and religious centers. It is worth mentioning Isabel Chimpú Ocllo, mother of our first mestizo chronicler, Garcilaso de la Vega, a woman considered the cornerstone of nationalism "because she inscribed on the glorious mestizo (Garcilaso) an entire doctrine of nationalism." Micaela Bastidas, the most glorious example of Peruvian women during the period of emancipation, was the extraordinary woman who encouraged and guided her husband, Tupac Amaru; she was the brave warrior who fought to the sound of the pututos and was massacred by the royalists, then dismembered, her body parts scattered across regions. Tomasa Cundememaita, Cecilia Túpac Amaru, Jala Maqui, Trinidad Celis, María Parado de Bellido, the Toledo Sisters, among others, are some of these glorious women who fought for the emancipation of our homeland and carried out their struggle to the bitter end.

  _THIRD WORLD WILL MEET IN LIMA_
  
  With the participation of representatives from 75 Third World nations, the Fifth Conference of Foreign Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries will be held in Lima from the 25th to the 29th of this month. A series of decisions will be made that will serve as recommendations for the Summit of Heads of State to be held next year in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon). The Crillón Hotel Convention Center will host this international event, considered the most authentic political movement organized within Third World countries to combat all forms of imperialism and colonialism. An Executive Organizing Committee, chaired by Ambassador Carlos Gamarra, has been working intensively.
  
  The entire infrastructure for this important event has been underway for two and a half months. The committees for accommodation, transportation, security, information, health, press, and public relations have already been formed, responsible for clearing the ground for the inauguration of the Fifth Conference. According to reports, nearly 800 people will be working on it, offering support and collaboration to the high-profile figures who will gather in Lima. In addition to the Foreign Ministers who will officially attend the Fifth Conference, representatives of nearly twenty liberation movements from Africa, Asia, and Latin America will be present as observer delegates. The meeting's agenda will be directly related to the Economic Policy of Underdeveloped Countries, with a definition of a strategy for strengthening solidarity and mutual aid in the political and economic spheres of non-aligned countries, confronting the threat of aggression against their sovereignty and independence, development, and security. The agenda will include topics related to the World Council of Raw Material Producers' Associations and the creation of a stock fund to regulate raw material prices. In addition to the establishment of a Model Statute for foreign investment and the conduct of transnational corporations, this meeting will also consider international policy and reality regarding conflicts in the Middle East, racism in South Africa, the establishment of a completely denuclearized Zone of Peace in the Indian Ocean, and statements regarding liberation processes and movements in countries such as Peru, Panama, and others around the world.

  _Quiruvilca Mine will continue to operate._
  
  Under no circumstances will the operations of the Quiruvilca Mining Unit be interrupted. Whatever decision is made in due course regarding the request of the Northern Peru Mining Corporation, the Ministry of Energy and Mines will adopt the necessary measures to ensure that Quiruvilca remains in operation. The Ministry of Energy and Mines announced this in a published bulletin. The document indicates that on July 21, 1975, the Ministry of Energy and Mines sent a commission of officials from the General Directorate of Mining to conduct a preliminary inspection of the Quiruvilca Mining Unit to provide an initial assessment of the overall problem.
  
  It is also reported that on July 7, 1975, the president of Northern Peru Mining Corporation submitted a communication to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, in which he expressed his desire to "transfer ownership and control of the operations to MINERO PERU or some other Peruvian entity as soon as possible to avoid the paralysis of said operations." This communication also refers to the "extremely adverse economic conditions" that the operation has been experiencing, accompanying a profit and loss statement from January 1 to May 31, 1975, which shows a loss of 64,783,170. 14 soles. In view of this situation, the company indicates its "impossibility of continuing to maintain the operations of the Quiruvilca Mining Unit", proposing that the transfer be made before September 1, 1975. The Energy and Mines bulletin aims to report in detail the situation raised, in view of the press information referring to the activities of the Northern Peru Mining Corporation, branch in Peru.

  _Alpaca breeding will be promoted._
  
  The proper marketing of the alpaca, as a meat animal and a source of textile fibers and finished products, could provide the country with a short-term income of approximately five billion soles. This was stated at a press conference by Engineer Alberto Pumayalla of the National Agrarian University, who is in charge of selecting a batch of 750 alpacas from the SAIS Pachacótec in Puno, which have been transferred to Capillalloc and Oxamachay, in Canta. The EPS Alpaca Perú was tasked yesterday with transferring the last group of alpacas to their new breeding facility, in conjunction with technicians from the Agrarian University. The new breeding facility is located in the area surrounding the La Viuda mountain peak. The transfer of the alpacas is part of a technical program aimed at establishing new breeding centers for the American camelid, which lives almost exclusively in Peru. With the establishment of the new farms, it is expected that within approximately 20 years, the alpaca population will increase, through appropriate technical treatment, to approximately 15 million heads.
  
  It's also worth noting that each alpaca provides approximately 15 kilos of highly nutritious and tasty meat, which has the added advantage of containing minimal fat and between three and a half and four pounds of wool fiber. Thanks to the efforts of the SAIS Pachacútec management, the animal was assigned large areas of natural pasture on the slopes of La Viuda Mountain in Canta. This will be the first of several alpaca farms designed to solve the country's meat supply problem and increase the production of textile fiber, of which the alpaca is a rich source.

  _Food is purchased from Hungary._
  
  Imports of wheat, food, and food industry products of Hungarian origin are guaranteed to cover popular consumption needs. The Revolutionary Government approved the agreement signed on May 12 of this year between representatives of the governments of Peru and Hungary, for an amount of 10 million US dollars. This agreement will finance 100 percent of the FOB value of the wheat and food imports in question, and the transaction will be settled within two years from the date of bill of lading for each delivery, accruing interest at 7 percent per year upon rebate. The Banco de la Nación has been authorized to carry out the necessary banking operations to implement the provisions of Decree Law 21231 approved on the 5th of this month. It will also open a checking account in soles called "Hungarian Wheat Imports 1975." The funds deposited in this account, from sales, would be intangible assets and would be used exclusively to pay obligations when they mature. For its part, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru will provide the necessary foreign currency to meet these obligations abroad.

  _They manage to grow potatoes in tropical areas._
  
  A series of important experiments have made it possible to cultivate potatoes for the first time in tropical zones and obtain the International Potato Award in La Molina. For about a year now, the Center has been working on hybrids that can later be adapted to the tropics. In that jungle area, they are searching for and perfecting the crop's future potential. Dr. Humberto Mendoza, of the Center's Genetics Department, explained yesterday that 31 days after planting, the potato grown in Yurimaguas generally reaches characteristics, he emphasized, that are edible or that can be introduced. Its cultivation takes about four months, and in the mountains, 6 months, since the normal cultivation time for potatoes on the coast is 6 months. The cultivation of this tuber in tropical zones of the country. And because until then, the completion of the cultivation of potatoes in tropical zones of the country had not been achieved, the potatoes that have been obtained under special conditions are usually sold in markets, but their other characteristics are similar. The Institutional Potato Center is an autonomous organization with branches in several countries around the world. Its director, Dr. Richard Sayer, reported on these investigations at a recent meeting of Directors in Washington, and they were disseminated by the Center for Biotechnology and Biotechnology. The achievements of this experiment have great significance, indicating that they may be edible. This does not mean that in the case of potatoes, this work is in its experimental stage of selection and testing, but it already shows a large number of tubers that could be edible in just 31 days.

  _Peru, Chile, and Bolivia agree to live in peace._
  
  LA PAZ, August 1975 (CRONICAWANPAO).- In the city of La Paz, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile reached a preliminary non-aggression pact, announced General Francisco Morales Bermúdez, Prime Minister of Peru. This revelation was made during a press conference held at the Peruvian Embassy in Bolivia. This agreement, said Minister Morales Bermúdez, was finalized during the meeting held by the President of Bolivia, General Hugo Bánzer, the Chief of Staff of Chile, General Sergio Arellano, and the Peruvian Prime Minister, with the purpose of removing any risk of armed conflict in this Latin American region. At the press conference, General Morales Bermúdez emphasized that it will be the governments of the three countries who will implement this commitment, since neither Peru, Bolivia, nor Chile desire war in the subregion. Non-Latin American interests are trying to provoke confrontations. Regarding Bolivia's landlocked status, the Peruvian Prime Minister stated that Peru would sympathetically and carefully analyze any formal proposal for a solution to the Bolivian problem, which is being negotiated directly between Bolivia and Chile. Any solution to the Bolivian problem must be approved by the Peruvian side in accordance with existing agreements.

  _PERU AND FRANCE RESTART_DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
  
  Lima, August 1975 (CRONICAWANPAQ) The Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially announced that diplomatic relations with France would be resumed, the reasons that led to their rupture having disappeared. Diplomatic relations between Peru and France were suspended as a result of the surface nuclear tests carried out by France, which Peru opposed because it considered that such tests jeopardized the health, security, and survival of its people due to the harmful and damaging effects they entailed.
  
  Before proceeding to break off relations, the Peruvian Government sent its French counterpart a series of protests and petitions demanding the suspension of atomic tests, considering, furthermore, that they in no way contributed to the efforts for peace and development that are imposed in the world. However, France, by continuing with its atomic tests in the Mururoa Atoll, caused the Peruvian government to proceed to break off diplomatic relations between both countries as an expression of its total repudiation of such acts, on July 23, 1973. Now, with the causes that originated said break having disappeared, the Peruvian Government, through a Communiqué, says: "Taking into account that the reasons that motivated the break off of its relations with France have disappeared, it has decided to restart them with the aim of promoting and strengthening the ties that have always united their respective countries.
