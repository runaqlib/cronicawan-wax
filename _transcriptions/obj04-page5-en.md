  **### Thinking about Farmer's Day**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Kampesinuq P'unchaynimpi Yuyamanasun*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  On the hills, at the doors of the huts, in the middle of the fields, crossing the rivers, traveling the roads. For a moment, men who work the land, let us think of ourselves, of the men who left, of the wounds of our grandparents, let us think of the men who died tied to the mitas, of those who were beheaded by the hands of the gamonales. Let us think of those lives and of this existence, men who work the land.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There can be no true revolution if we do not first think of Man. Man is the foundation of this world, of the world above, of the world of shadows. He was at the beginning of all things and will be there after the catastrophes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Man is above all, he is the initial number of the orders. The world was built only by man, things were built for him. Peoples walk for him and even wars are sometimes fought in defense of man.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  For these reasons, the Peruvian Revolution says: Man comes first, let us build our people so that man lives with dignity. We do not want men to persist divided into two antagonistic groups of poor and rich. Let men live with one dignity, that is what the Peruvian Revolution says. Walking on our own we must change the political, economic and social system that our people choose.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The substantial existence of the Peruvian people dawned with the law of the Agrarian Reform. When the land returned to the hands of its legitimate owners, the people and their soul set out on their journey forever. The land had no owner in its origins, it was the land that was there for all to live, so that by sowing in it men could live. Thinking about this common principle, the Peruvian Revolution returned the land to the poor men, to the men who truly work the land.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But, it is not only that, this Revolution is putting the flag of the poor in the hands of the people. This Revolution is the seed of other days of joy. This Revolution is raising the foundations of another society from its foundations, for the love of children. This Revolution has given us back new dreams of life, a human existence and an incorruptible virile attitude.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  With this Revolution we are reaching the root of the days, we are reaching the emotional explosion of the heart, we are sprouting like unbreakable flowers.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Looking at these things we must think again about Farmer's Day:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Farmers' Day is a day without riverbanks. Now the land is in the hands of those who work it. For this and for this reason laws have been passed. The Water Law, which says that cooperatives are being built. Farmers receive the true wage for their efforts. We have only achieved all this with the Revolution. BECAUSE the Peruvian Revolution is truly a Re-revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The differences between the poor and the rich are diminishing. The poor and the rich are coming together, uniting as one people, bridging their differences without spilling blood as other revolutions did. That is the Revolution. Peruvian, Nationalist, Independent, Humanist.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ALL of us who work on the land must be sentinels of this Revolution, we must take care of it, just as it remembers us, it takes care of us. We must walk alongside the Revolution. We must praise the Revolution, we must defend the Revolution. Only the Revolution is the sun of the poor.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There is no great day if we do not think about the meaning of that day. In six years the Revolution has come a long way. It has forged a good path with a man's step. Soldiers and men of the people have walked as one man. That is being a revolutionary: to support with work what we affirm with the word.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In this new year, let us salute our President, General Juan Velasco Alvarado. And let us shout again: Yes! Once again, I swear by the Revolution.
  
  **### Our Greetings to the People of Cusco**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *What is the meaning of the word*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  On your day we greet you, people of Cusco. On behalf of all the peoples of Peru we greet you. From Cusco, civilization began in the time of the Incas, for the settlements of antiquity.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Cusco is like the soul of Peru, full of memories, it is the greatest foundation of Peru.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But we cannot exhaust ourselves looking at the years that have gone by. We cannot look only at what the Incas did. We must look at Cusco in its bustle of these days, in the sweat of our fellow countrymen, in the fountain of the children, in the play of those who will come.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  We would be looking at the dead if we only contemplated the walls that the Incas raised. Those roots are good, they are even better for explaining these days. But we must do our part, so that those who come after us speak of our footprints. So that they praise the walls that we raise.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Let us walk the paths well. Let us take the rain of shadows in a beautiful life, let us bury the hail of tears, so that no one lives among sobs as a thorn of misfortune. We must welcome the day of Cusco as the end of times of mourning.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Let us live other dawns. Let us live the days of social justice on earth, let us live the true sun of life, and in its fire let us live with one heart, one strength, for our people, for our children, for ourselves.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  May the people of Cusco rise this year as one man. And may the people, thinking of Cusco, put their hearts into everything they do. May the authorities order with true intelligence, may the judges look with their hearts at the errors of others. Forever, forever, great in your greatness, people of Cusco. Always see an existence of plenitude.
  
  **Men who sow hatred**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Cheqniy tarpuq runakuna*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Why do the hatemongers, defending the gringos in bastard writings, insult those of us who work at La Crónica with their absolutely poisonous tongues? Why do the landowners' errand boys, the former foremen, since they saw a newspaper in Quechua, with their obfuscated reptilian tongues, insult the workers at La Crónica?
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These men do not want us to speak in Quechua. They do not want us to speak in the language of the men who work the land. Those who wake up in the snows of hatred do not want us to speak the truth. They do not like us to talk about the Revolution.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Those who insult the men who work at LA CRÓNICA are afraid of the Revolution. Why? That's what we're going to talk about.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  As we already know, they were the ones who in past years, with the tale of the revolution, deceived the men who work in the fields. They imposed quotas saying: For the party, for the party! and the party was their belly. They are the same ones who received money from the local bosses, for the art of deceiving the poor.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  These scams ended with the Revolution, and so, like stray dogs, they walk around biting whoever they can. And since what was written in CRONICAWAN is now enlightening the peasants, they hate those of us who write the truth.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But we have already sworn by the flag of the Revolution. We are not afraid of men with thorns on their tongues, we will trample on them like worms the partisans of the bosses. We, like the condors, look at the horizons, we live and fly in the light of the sun, never will those accustomed to theft like mice, those who only see where they can prey, ever reach us. Our flag is our strength, the soul of the people sustains us and we believe in the men of the people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The men with viperous tongues will not reach us.

  DEFINITION OF THE INFILTRATOR
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Infiltration and the activities of infiltrators in the revolutionary ranks are issues that have been repeatedly discussed in the country. It is not out of place to attempt a quick analysis that shows us the reasons that explain this phenomenon.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  First of all, we must agree on the nature of infiltration as a political act. Infiltration is an activity that consists of masking the political objectives of an individual or group in order to be able to penetrate other institutions and impose on them from within lines of action that are foreign to them. Infiltrators may agree with the ideological or political approaches of the organization or institution they intend to capture; but in reality they have different or opposing intentions. The infiltrator always has a double or triple game and trusts in the naivety and lack of perspicacity of his adversaries to crown his efforts with success. Infiltrators use the most varied resources to hide their activities; but one of the most frequent resources consists of indiscriminately accusing their adversaries of being infiltrators. With the aim of hiding his dark dealings, the infiltrator slanders half the world with the label of infiltrator. There is no doubt that the maneuver is skillful and that it manages to disorient some people.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  There is no doubt that throughout the process individuals and groups of various tendencies have tried and still try to infiltrate it. The infiltrators of all kinds started from the assumption that this process was relatively easy to control, since it lacked its own political organization and that its ideology was in the process of progressive enrichment and development. Without our own political organization and without an ideology published in 10 volumes, the infiltrators thought, we can “sell our organization ideology.” They believed that the rejection of the traditional parties and the lack of a dogmatic and intolerant ideology were symptoms of weakness. But in their strategy the infiltrators had overlooked a fundamental fact: that the Revolution had been initiated by the Armed Forces and was being led by them. This fact largely explains the failure of the infiltrators in their vain efforts to impose their political criteria on the process. To be successful, the infiltrators would have had to have first captured the command positions in the country’s military apparatus, a task that was certainly doomed to failure; the APRA had already unsuccessfully attempted this maneuver in the 1930s.
  
  **Secret Chronicle**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  *Pakasqa Qelqa*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  “Door of the Almudena prison, like the judge with a heart of tin, when I cross your doors, like the dead I rot away.” That is what I sang when I was in prison and the peasants who accompanied me in my misfortune cried a single tear with me.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In prison I heard the stories of the soulless judges. Men live there for years, buried between walls. Remembering these things makes my heart sad.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  But when I open the newspapers now, on the first page, what they call “front page,” I read a news item that says: 237 peasants will be released from prison after being pardoned. My heart bursts with joy to hear that.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The clerks, the judges, the guards and even the witnesses. They were all enemies of the peasants. The judges never ruled in favor of the peasants in the trials. But the prisons and the beatings were for the peasants. They were tied up like beasts inside the prisons.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  The Revolutionary Government has forgiven this suffering in its immense heart. It has said that all these men should return to their farms, that they should return to their villages again. It has said that they should get on the right path, that they should restart the life of true men.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Prisons are becoming empty, that is good. We must receive this fact with applause, we must receive it with feeling. It is good that men who had the misfortune of making mistakes are forgiven, so that they can rise again from the tears of their misfortune.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Life is difficult for the poor. Even the roads are lost in the heart of the rocks, the paths end in the woods, even joy lasts only a moment, nothing exists forever. The only thing that is true is the wound. The wounds of the men who lived in prison, watched by dark guards, are spreading.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  It is a cause for deep joy that our peasant comrades have been pardoned. They will have learned in years of misfortune, in endless nights, tied up, buried by the walls, and will say, let us walk on a good path, so that the people may rejoice with us.
