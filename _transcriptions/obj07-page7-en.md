  **YOUTH TALKS ABOUT QUECHUA**
  
  _WAYNAKUNAN_RUNASIMIMANTA RIMANKU
  
  Youth is disoriented. They live in a pandemonium of influences; they feel alienated. They rebel because society does not provide them with the incentives for life or the ideals of heroism that once motivated the behavior of youth. The mass media not only shape the behavior of young people, they also guide and direct them according to the demands of a consumer society. Habits, ornaments, norms, and poses reflect the maelstrom of capitalist society; at the same time, they create false images, borrowed ideals, fraudulent slogans, and cultural sauveniers that openly challenge the essence of the
  
  Nationality. Precisely for the reasons mentioned above, we interviewed two young people about their thoughts on Quechua. For today's youth, the aboriginal world is not only a challenge, it is also a question, the answer to which depends on the development of a cultural policy that truly reflects the circumstances of a people in transformation, the difficulties of a nation undergoing change, and the uniqueness of a Revolution that equally challenges the two great ideological systems prevailing in our time. One of our interviewees is a young man from the provinces, acculturated to the capital's norms of life. The other is from Lima, trained in personalistic and individualizing competition, and knows that the world is difficult and that during the day, the "I" comes before the "we." We ask them a general question; they both look at each other smiling. Raúl Negreiros is the first to respond. "Frankly, I don't see the spark in this officialization of Quechua. Perhaps for those who are going to live in the provinces, we don't need it because of Acanga." CRONICAWAN: Do you know about the existence of a newspaper in Quechua? -- We don't even read Spanish, things are so complicated. EYE, it's cool because of the spines... also the TERCERA for sports. The newspapers should have sports and sections... CRONICAWAN: Would you like to get to know the interior of the country? -- Of course, they say Cusco is crazy, all cholita and cholito. I'd like to travel in Faucett with everything paid or in my carrandanga. I like to travel, meet other people, go to new places, get drunk while chatting. I'd like to travel instead of studying. And you, - we say to Raúl's friend - Willy Rendon answers:
  
  It's good to know Quechua, but it's difficult. With English and Quechua, I become a locumbant. I sincerely believe that English should be taught instead of Quechua. Progress is in English. Quechua is merely sentimental. To get to know Peru, English is for living it up.
  
  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: Tape recorder in hand, we walk to the Malecón Cisneros in Miraflores, where Ricardo Palma University is located. Its Interpreter and Translator Program includes a Quechua course. We talk with a group of girls, all of whom are taking Quechua as a subject. None of them want to give personal statements, so the version collected is a collective opinion: CRONICAWAN: What do you think about the officialization of Quechua? It's a wise move. It has its pros and cons. On the positive side, there's the fact that it provides equal opportunities—at least linguistically to monolingual Quechua and Spanish speakers—but forcing them to learn is overstepping the mark. Any imposition is tyranny. For someone with the time necessary to dedicate themselves to the history of Inca Peru, Quechua is of no use to them. We are certain that teaching Quechua in predominantly Castilian cities will be a failure, just as teaching English in small mountain villages will be a failure. At university, Quechua is more difficult than Greek. It seems like a tongue-twister of contrasts and anachronisms, like memorizing Plato's syllogisms. Why do Quechua teachers? They don't make the course's dreamy teaching of how complicated it is any simpler or more didactic: it seems as if they insist on making it more embarrassing and intricate. We even like Quechua, but the classes terrify us, due to the number of problems and glottalizations we have to solve and master in each class hour. However, not all teachers are "difficult." There are some who make themselves perfectly understandable. We think that if the teachers had made the effort, the students would learn faster. We would have liked to continue talking with the girls from Ricardo Palma University. Their concepts are transcendent for those who teach Quechua. The utter sincerity with which they express their opinions restores our faith. Not all is lost; youth continues to be the yeast of history.

  _MAN'S VOICE_
  
  No one knew how to find and make the musical soul of things sing like he did. Because everything in him was music. Under the spell of his voice, the spirit of objects—spoons, flowers, or seashells—took shape, took shape, and there it remains forever, telling us that beneath the outer crust of objects, beneath the metallic skin of machines, the fork, or the sap deep within the vegetal epidermis of copihues, there are rivers of musical blood, of eternal palpitations. Who, if not he, longed for the subterranean seas that beat imprisoned in numerous seashells? Who, if not he, deciphered the wailing of scissors, the creaking of doors, the nocturnal murmur of stones. If he said, "Bread," the wheat ripened in his words, and in his smile, hunger dissolved as if in a magic trick. If he named the Evening, all the birds in the world would flock to his voice to lie down and sleep until the next morning. An unrepentant devourer of roads, no one seemed to be tied to all directions like him. That's why his homeland was all the homelands of the world, and his brothers and sisters, the inhabitants of all homelands. It has been said of him that he was a poet; I, on the other hand, think his profession was that of a potter of hope, an architect of dreams of peace, a fighter for humanity and all its battles. He was Chilean, it's true, but that doesn't mean it can be said that joy, faith, and trust have borders, or that courage, tenderness, and dawn need a passport to be simply that: courage, tenderness, and dawn. From his photographs—and there are thousands of them—he looks at us like a sad brother who comes to ask us the exact time of dusk, but he would enter the homes of all his neighbors to recommend the menu or win a vote for his departure. I knew him. That's not much to say, it's true, but I can assure you that his arms fluttered over the objects like living flags of hope. Everyone knows his name, sorry, what Pablo was called, is called, and will be called tomorrow."
