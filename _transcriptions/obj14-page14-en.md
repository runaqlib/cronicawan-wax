  **A NEW REALITY FOR THE PERUVIAN WOMAN**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Summarizing somewhat the reality of Peruvian women, up to the present when they have already begun to decide actions aimed at eradicating their past of injustice and revaluing their role as women and citizens of a changing country, it can be seen that socio-cultural factors and traditional behavioral patterns constitute an obstacle that is difficult to overcome in a short time. Discrimination against women in the popular sectors - for example - makes them accept the worst working conditions. On the other hand, in urban areas, a distorted image has been created for years through education, the media and life itself, a mistaken image of the "woman wife" and "selfless woman" and, at the same time, a woman appreciated and defined by her "physical beauty" her "sexual attributes." The traditional system with its advertising has conditioned society as a whole to have a vision of the passive, conservative, selfless woman. Mostly technically and intellectually incapable, "apolitical", dependent, provocative. Statistically, it can be noted that half of the inhabitants of Peru are women. Regarding the economically active population, the ratio is 4 men for every woman. Of this total of economically active women, the majority have their occupation as "their home", that is, they present a situation of economic dependence. In the legal aspect, despite the recent modifications by the current government, married women are still in a status of inferiority. It is worth clarifying that basically the legal problems of Peruvian women fundamentally refer to the application of laws that protect them. In terms of education, it should be noted that the dropout rate of the female school population is higher than that of males. As for illiteracy, it is higher among women. Faced with this real situation of Peruvian women highlighted in Art. 23 of the Inca Plan, considering that the General Assembly of the United Nations had proclaimed 1975 International Women's Year and in accordance with the humanist and participatory conception that guides its actions, the government creates the National Commission for Peruvian Women... Entity chaired by Rosa Pedraglio de Morales Bermúdez, wife of the President of the Republic, who since last Friday took charge of the direction of CONAMUP.
