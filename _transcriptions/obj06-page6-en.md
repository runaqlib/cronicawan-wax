  _HOW MAN WAS MADE_FARMER
  
  As we've already said, humans lived like wild animals, in that way of life, and after a long process, language emerged. It probably arose through imitation of the beasts they lived with; their language was cries. This language appeared in humans when their brains were sufficiently developed, when their auditory system and vocal apparatus were conditioned for language. We've also discussed how the family emerged, how long it took for societies as we know them to form, how they lived, and how they reproduced.
  
  Now we will talk about how men began to sow and how they began to domesticate animals.
  
  HOW THE FIRST ANIMALS WERE DOMESTICATED
  
  In ancient times, there were only wild animals. Humans were also savages. Since they didn't know how to work, they only ate the fruits of trees; that was the basis of their livelihood. Even this harvesting was difficult, and they often died in this action, as they were often devoured by animals. At the same time, humans insisted on killing these wild animals, so much so that in addition to defending themselves from them, they relied on their meat, which they began to eat to sustain themselves. However, it was increasingly difficult to hunt them, so the idea of ​​raising them arose. However, since there were gigantic animals, what kind of animals did they begin to raise? They were possibly the smallest ones or those that were most useful to them. Already in this period, humans began to live in communities, and then, grouping together, they surrounded the animals so they couldn't escape and captured them. But we must say that large beasts continued to exist at the same time. As evidence of this, we are still finding bone remains of these animals. To give you an idea, these animals were larger than the houses we live in. As time passed, these animals began to disappear. Since humans of that time began to raise animals, peoples whose way of life was based on herding emerged.
  
  HOW THEY STARTED FARMING
  
  When the fruits of the trees began to decline, animal husbandry probably also began, and a similar process occurred in agriculture. Since men, having become shepherds, no longer walked from one place to another as before, women also stopped accompanying them wherever they went, staying in certain areas, watching what they grew, and staying at home. By staying at home, it was women who discovered agriculture; they made us understand that the land must be worked. They taught us how to plant potatoes, corn, etc. From that time on, farming communities existed.
  
  THE WAR.
  
  Not all peoples were farmers, just as not all peoples were hunters and/or shepherds. There were peoples who relied on war to survive, that is, through war they obtained the necessary means for their subsistence, subjugating the farming and shepherding peoples, turning them into slaves, that is, making them work for their benefit. From that time on, slaves appeared and the ruling classes also emerged.
  
  At this stage we already find the inequality between the
  
  Men. The weak, in order to survive, had to work for the powerful. To reach this state of affairs, they stopped for many years.
