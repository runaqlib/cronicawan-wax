  _THE MARCONA IS OURS_
  
  July 25, 1975, will remain an extraordinary day in the history of Peru for Marcona and our people. In Marcona, the people, as one, gathered to celebrate the nationalization of the Marcona Mining Company, thus participating in the achievement of our second independence. In the face of abuse and imperialist arrogance, the Peruvian Revolution was present and took possession of one of the largest iron ore complexes in Latin America, which until yesterday had been plundered by the voracious imperialist Marcona Mining Company, a tentacle of a transnational corporation.
  
  It is evident that this new recovery of our wealth, necessary in itself, had become especially urgent due to the behavior of this transnational corporation, both recently and throughout its presence in our territory. There is, therefore, in the present case an element of the moralizing always upheld by the Revolution. It is also known that in 1945, the Peruvian Santa Corporation was assigned the Marcona iron deposits, located in the department of Ica, to later be exploited by a local branch of the Utah Construction Company and Marcona Mining Company. The preamble to Decree 21228, which expropriated the local branch of the Marcona Mining Company, establishes a series of contractual breaches by the company, which constitute typical examples of predatory actions by transnational corporations that disrespect the rights of the countries whose resources they extract. Hence, General Jorge Fernández Maldonado clearly reminded the Peruvian Revolution in his message to the nation: "The Peruvian Revolution, which does not wish to be the enemy of anyone, will not compromise, however, in defending the interests of the Revolutionary Homeland. Here, foreign companies STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE LAWS AND LEAVE. There is no other alternative, and there will not be one with our Revolutionary Government." After a series of deliberations by a government commission and the corresponding commission for this transnational company, no favorable solutions were reached. The commission appointed for this purpose found the Marcona Mining Company's proposal unacceptable and consequently decided on its immediate expropriation. For all these reasons, Decree Law 21228 declares the nationalization of the Marcona Mining Company Mining-Metallurgical Complex operating in the country to be of public necessity and utility. The company HIERRO--PERU was also created, and a man of the integrity, ability, and revolutionary vocation of General (r) Juan Bossio Collas was placed at its head. MARCONA HAS REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE FOREVER.
  
  **BAYOVAR HATARISHANMI**
  
  _Bayóvar development lever_
  
  On the burning sands of the Sechura Desert, where only small shrubs such as zapotes and vichayos grow, rises the Bayóvar Complex, considered the largest and most ambitious project ever undertaken in Peru. More than 80 billion soles will be dedicated to this monumental project, which represents the lever for development in northern Peru.
  
  On the 21st, the head of the Bayóvar Complex Executive Committee (CECOMBA), Major General Guillermo Arbulu Galliani, presented the scope of this project to the nation and detailed each of its branches. He reported that the North Peruvian Oil Pipeline Terminal is already under construction, which over a one hundred kilometer stretch is located within the Bayóvar area. The investment - he said - is 1,397"070,000.00 soles and will be used to supply the tankers anchored at the oil dock, also under construction. The dock will allow loading 100 thousand barrels per hour. He also stated that in 1979 the oil refinery will be in operation, which will be twice the size of the one in Talara and four times the size of the one in La Pampilla. The investment exceeds 8.9 billion soles. The Head of CECOMBA also explained that the fertilizer plant is in a pre-feasibility study and will produce 600%-900 metric tons of ammonia and urea per day. In 1980, the Integrated Petrochemical Complex, which includes basic chemicals, will begin operating. intermediate and final. Referring to the Phosphate Plant, he noted that in its first stage, it will produce 800,000 metric tons of phosphate rock concentrate annually, beginning in 1977. Two years later, it will produce 460,000 tons of phosphoric acid annually, 337,000 tons of triple superphosphate, and 231,000 tons of diammonium phosphate. He also indicated that the Metallurgical Complex will produce 200,000 tons of refined zinc, 200,000 tons of refined copper, and 700,000 tons of sulfuric acid. The Brine Plant will produce, beginning in 1979, 100,000 tons of potassium chloride and one million tons of sodium chloride annually.
