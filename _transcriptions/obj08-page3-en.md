  _JAPANESE SHIP SINKS_
  
  The Tuna Clipper "Kube Naru 16" of 30 tons valued at 40 million soles was built 6 years ago by the Japanese firm "Kanashi" and for two years has been fishing in Peru especially in tuna fishing, which game is transported to Japanese ports for distribution, as announced by Yonrichiro Kubo, 68 years old, owner of the ship and crew member. This modern Tuna Clipper under the Japanese flag sank with 170 tons of tuna on board, saving 19 crew members from drowning, who managed to save themselves by swimming and with the help of another Japanese fishing boat that was fishing in the area. The tuna boat that saved them arrived at the port of Callao on July 14. The Tuna Clipper "Kubo Marú 16" sank on July 11th at 12:10 p.m. while operating with its 19 crew members 520 miles off the coast near Ecuador, according to reports from the Callao Port Authority. This vessel has been in Peru for eight months, and all of its cargo was being transported to Japan. The sinking was due to a fault in the ship's stern, where water entered through a leak. Peruvian Navy vessels have headed to the scene of the tragedy, 520 miles offshore, where the Tuna Clipper sank, in order to explore the possibility of salvaging the sunken vessel. Meanwhile, it was reported that authorities from the Callao Port Authority have begun the relevant investigations to determine responsibility and submit their report to the Ministry of the Navy.

  _REMEMBER MARTYRS_FROM NINABAMBA
  
  It is common knowledge, according to statements by the leaders of the Revolutionary Process taking place in our country, that the unity of the Armed Forces and the People is becoming more and more consolidated every day, as demonstrated by the First National Convention of the Peasant Youth of Peru, closely linked to the nascent Revolutionary Youth of Peru. This First National Convention of the Peasant Youth of Peru was held over five consecutive days in the department of Cusco, and was attended by around 250 young peasants representing the Agrarian Leagues, Federations, the Regional Committee of Cusco and Madre de Dios, and the National Agrarian Confederation. The integrationist role of Youth in the Revolutionary Process was debated at this grand event, especially as it is the custodian of the Agrarian Reform Law, a pillar of the Peruvian Revolution as a whole. After intense work deliberating the papers presented, this national event was successfully concluded in the town of Urcos, capital of the Quispicanchis Province, in honor of the Martyrs of Ninabamba. A message was read from the Minister of Agriculture, General Enrique Gallegos Venero, who reiterated his call to the youth, his deep and indestructible conviction that the unity of the Armed Forces and the People, born on October 3, 1968, is the only guarantee of the triumph of the Peruvian Revolution. It is also worth mentioning the names of the peasants gunned down by local boss Luna Oblitas on December 25, 1963, during the sellout government of Fernando Belaúnde Terry: Gabriel Muñiz, Andrés Ccorasi, Bemabé Willcahuamán, Eulogia Rimachi, Isaac Jaquehua, Juliana Wilcahuamán, and Gabina Quispe.
