page2-eng: 'Ideological foundations of the Peruvian revolution The Peruvian Revolution
  is an autonomous process that is developing to transform the political, economic
  and social system of the De and cancel our condition of underdeveloped, capitalist,
  oligarchic society subjected to the interests of imperialism, in order to build
  a social democracy in which all Peruvians can realize themselves through full participation
  in the exercise of social power within a truly sovereign national community. The
  Peruvian Revolution defines itself as Nationalist and Independent and is doctrinally
  based on a Revolutionary Humanism that is clearly opposed to systems of social exploitation
  and to dogmatic and totalitarian systems. Therefore, it rejects the capitalist and
  communist systems. 1.-FOR BEING A NATIONALIST. — Affirms and defends the sovereignty
  of Peru, guaranteeing its autonomous development and comprehensive security; — It
  collects and develops the historical and cultural legacy of the Peruvian people,
  in particular its traditions of solidarity work and communal property; —It seeks
  to affirm our national personality, recognizing and stimulating its diverse cultural
  and social variants; —It advocates the authentic and transformative integration
  of Peru as a social and political entity; —He staunchly defends the nation''s resources;
  and — Ensures the right of Peruvians to “develop their own ideological and political
  concepts, cultural expressions and institutional forms arising from the historical
  tradition and creative spirit of our people. 2.-FOR BEING INDEPENDENT. — It affirms
  its full conceptual and political autonomy and therefore rejects any attempt at
  foreign interference; — It takes a militant stance against any form of external
  domination or political, economic or military dependence on any international centre
  of power; — It directs its actions towards achieving integration and autonomous
  regional development in Latin America. —It declares its position as a non-aligned
  country and places itself among the third world countries; and — It advocates a
  new concept of international relations and cooperation, to build an effective community
  of free and sovereign nations based on equality. As a nationalist and independent
  country, the Peruvian Revolution maintains an unwavering anti-imperialist position.
  Consequently, it supports the People''s Record against all forms of imperialism,
  colonialism and international subordination. 3.- REVOLUTIONARY HUMANISM. — Considers
  man as an end and not as a means, recognizing him as the social maker of history;
  —It postulates the full realization of the human person, conceiving freedom and
  justice as inseparable values and rejecting all forms of exploitation; —It aims
  to build true human coexistence based on solidarity; — It promotes the liberation
  of man from all forms of domination and therefore rejects the existence of any oligarchy:
  — Advocates a morality for action based on the correspondence between means and
  ends: and — Recognizes tolerance as a value and, therefore, rejects dogmatism by
  denying violence as a system. Revolutionary Humanism brings together important strands
  of social thought that have emerged from the universal historical tradition to which
  Peru belongs. This legacy is essentially expressed in socialist thought, libertarian
  thought and Christian thought. In them, the Peruvian Revolution finds a fundamental
  source of inspiration for its transformative action. 1. Revolutionary Humanism draws
  on the legacy of non-dogmatic and non-totalitarian socialist thought by: —To postulate
  that work is the original source of wealth; — Propose that, within a pluralist economy,
  the means of production should be primarily socially owned; —Promote the role of
  state ownership for the benefit of the entire national community, within the new
  conception of the Participatory State, and —Aspire to an order in which socially
  generated goods benefit their producers and the entire society. 1. Revolutionary
  Humanism embraces the heritage of libertarian thought by: —To postulate within a
  supportive society, as an inviolable right, the essential freedom of the human being
  from all forms of arbitrariness and imposition; —To advocate that power and decisions
  arise with the least possible mediation, from the social base in accordance with
  the interests of the entire nation; and — Promote the creative sense of individuals
  and groups by affirming their autonomy and social responsibility to make their own
  decisions. 1. Revolutionary Humanism is inspired by Christian thought by: —Uphold
  the essential equality of all men, the foundation of human fraternity, and reject,
  consequently, all forms of social and economic injustice, —To highlight the value
  of solidarity and propose the elimination of the causes that have historically created
  inequality, hatred and struggle among Peruvians; —To affirm that only by building
  a just society can men have true freedom and fully develop their personality in
  all its dimensions; —To aspire to the construction of an authentic human coexistence
  to achieve a society without exploiters or exploited, the only real basis of union
  between all Peruvians; and - Recognize that the family constitutes the foundation
  of society and is a school of the richest humanism. 1. The essence of these revolutionary
  traditions is expressed in the fundamental participatory character of the Peruvian
  Revolution which: —It proposes the opening of broad and multiple channels that give
  all Peruvians access to decisions at the various levels and fields of social activity:
  —He affirms that the existence of institutions based on the democratic intervention
  of their members is an essential condition for the full development of individuals
  and social groups: —Promotes the use of authentically democratic methods in achieving
  its political, social and economic objectives; —It advocates a new conception of
  the structure of the State based on the elimination of centralism and bureaucratization;
  —It advocates organized access for workers to management, ownership and profits
  of companies. — It favors the progressive transfer of economic and political power
  for its social exercise by autonomous institutions of Peruvian workers and, therefore,
  rejects its manipulative concentration; —It defends the autonomy of social organizations
  against any attempt at external control and, consequently, rejects the political
  institutionalization of the Revolution in the form of a party. e: Obeying the meaning
  of these traditions, the Peruvian Revolution assumes a fundamental pluralist character
  by virtue of which. - It recognizes the right of all Peruvians to disagree and criticize
  and, consequently, to organize themselves politically with complete freedom to support
  different positions. Therefore, it admits the legitimacy of the existence of groups
  and parties that express diverse political alternatives. Faced with them, the Peruvian
  Revolution poses its own coherent and homogeneous position, not accepting within
  its ranks any approaches that contradict or distort its ideological and political
  foundations; and — In the economic field, it supports various forms of ownership
  and organization of companies, within a dynamic and flexible concept, recognizing:
  a priority sector of social ownership in which ownership belongs to all workers
  of the companies in the sector; a state sector in which the State assumes control
  of basic activities for the development and benefit of the community; a reformed
  private sector leading to co-management and an exclusively private ownership sector
  made up of small-scale activities in commerce, artisanal industry and services.
  4.- Based on these ideological bases, the Peruvian Revolution sets as its final
  objective the construction of a SOCIAL DEMOCRACY OF FULL PARTICIPATION whose essential
  elements are: 1. A participatory political system based on popular bases; 2. A pluralistic
  economic system based on a priority sector of social ownership; and 3. A social
  system based on a set of behaviors and moral values that emphasize justice, freedom,
  work, participation, solidarity, creativity, honesty and respect for the dignity
  of the human person. Lima, February 25, 1975: Central Information Office'

  Mister Director of the newspaper LA CRONICA I am pleased to address you to greet
  you very cordially and through you to pass on my request. I would greatly appreciate
  it if you would send me a copy of your newspaper edited in Quechua, especially for
  Tuesday, June 10, as on its pages there are translations from Spanish into Quechua
  and not only that, there is other information, such as the one from June 7, entirely
  in Quechua, because the edition of CRONICAWAN edited in Quechua does not reach this
  part of the country, the only goal I have is to learn Quechua. Because here in this
  part of the South of the country that is Tacna, Quechua is not spoken, I am almost
  sure that many other citizens like me will be eager to learn Quechua now that it
  is official, thanks to our Revolutionary Government. I am a humble citizen who works
  as a street vendor. I hope you will excuse me. Sincerely : Ricardo Cardenas Chacolli
  LE 5768695 Address: Zarumilla No, 700 or Tacna Central Post Office San Sebastian,
  June 13, 1975. Mister Guillermo Thorndike Director of the newspaper La Crónica,
  . Dear Mr. First I greet you with all my heart. We, the poor of Cusco, are truly
  happy. The farmers, the factory workers, we have all received with great joy the
  immense gift of General Velasco, who has returned our Runasimi to us. Perhaps it
  is the gods who live in heaven who have sent the General to redeem our suffering
  people; because he is doing very well in firmly cutting off attempts at opposition
  and at the same time and with the same firmness putting back into place what until
  now was in chaos. For this reason, we Cuscoans are overjoyed. Today, raising our
  heads high, we will speak our language at the same height, and no one will humiliate
  themselves, even if they mock us with the cholo and the Indian. Through this letter
  I call upon all the people of Pumamarca, so that with immense joy and putting our
  strength into action, we make Mother Earth produce generously, so that we can help
  our Revolution. Those who, like the Santa Rosa Pro Housing Association, under the
  name of “revolutionaries”, intend to take away what is ours will not be able to
  take our lands from us. They want to take away the fertile lands of Pata-Paula from
  us in order to negotiate. But everyone already knows the shrewd thinking of leaders
  like Juan Vargas. Dr. Ignacio Tello Campodónico, member of the Supreme Court of
  Lima, is already aware of this. Mr. Guillermo, a gentleman born in the fervor of
  the Revolution, that is all I have to say to you. With the same faith and the same
  fervor, I beg you, Mr. Guillermo, to be kind enough to publish my letter in our
  CRONICAWAN. That is all we ask of you, the threads of the poor peasants. Until another
  day. Benigno Ccoscco Pantiyoso LM.402863950'

  MARQUEZ, June 1975 (From our services). Lorenzo Marquez is the capital of Mozambique.
  Mozambique is located on the east coast of Africa, has an area of 785,000 square
  kilometers and about 7 million inhabitants. For many years, Mozambicans have been
  waging a war against the colonialist forces of Portugal to obtain their independence.
  Fortunately, on April 25, 1974, the Portuguese Armed Forces started a revolution.
  The new Portuguese rulers understood that there is no force in the world capable
  of defeating and bending the will of the people. As a result, they began talks with
  the Mozambican groups fighting for their independence and reached an agreement to
  decolonize Mozambique. Therefore, from these days onwards a new nation will be created,
  the Republic of Mozambique. The UN will help Bolivia, Chile and Peru Onu Yanapanqa

  Eustaquio Maylle declares in Havana Havana llaqtapi, Eustaquio Maylle rimarin Havana,
  June 1975. (Prensa Latina). Eustaquio Maylle, President of the National Agrarian
  Confederation of Peru, in statements to journalists said: All of us who are here
  in Cuba have met our brothers from Cuba and have traveled around this country getting
  to know it. We have been to all the places, we have learned their stories, all their
  struggles. We have learned about the struggles of our brother Fidel Castro. We too
  have fought hard for the Peruvian Revolution. I wish that all my brothers, all the
  peasants, all the workers, would come to a single agreement, like here in Cuba,
  so that we can make a new life flourish, build the New Society. Eustaquio Maylle
  then said: The National Agrarian Confederation brings together more than 4 million
  farmers. This unity is now possible in Peru, thanks to the existence of a new policy.
  All the peasants, the workers, those of us who were despised for a long time, those
  of us who were forgotten, are now united by this new policy. Since we are men, from
  a single country, we must also speak our own language, that is why the Revolutionary
  Government of Juan Velasco Alvarado, has made Runa Simi official, with it everything
  that we had forgotten for many years, with our language we will now recover. Now
  doctors, lawyers, engineers will speak this language. All peasants speak this language,
  since it is their language. This law will help all Peruvians to unite as if we were
  one, to find a better future. Eustaquio Maylle also said: On June 7, we took a single
  oath, the Armed Forces, all the people and President Juan Velasco Alvarado, to be
  one union, one force. Here in Cuba, I cannot forget that. US government accused

  is located on the African continent and has an area of 2,340,000 square kilometers.
  Zaire produces mainly diamonds, gold and copper. The Zaire government has accused
  the US and its leaders of attempting to assassinate President Mobutu Sese Seko and
  stage a coup. President Mohutu himself confirmed this when he announced that some
  military personnel involved in the plot had been arrested. This shows once again
  that the CIA is willing to commit the most horrific crimes in order to achieve its
  goals. With these hands Kay makiwanmi These hands cultivated the land. Buried in
  the snow, in the stones or in the water, these hands multiplied the seeds. The blood
  of these hands quenched the thirst of the earth, only these hands defeated the hardest
  fatigue. The landowners became rich through the work of these hands. They are hands
  shaped by fire, which grasped all the disdain and crushed all the impossibles. These
  hands are working hands, like precise furrows thirsty for life, like burning sand
  that is edged with blood and rejoices. These hands buried life and death in their
  wrinkles: In this land, on this land, within this land, only these hands, only these
  hands were clenched for the cause of man. These hands have discovered the secrets,
  deciphered the enigmas and the keys. However, how many things these hands do not
  know, what paths these hands did not save, what thorny settlers did not pull from
  their forges. Only these hands collected and accumulated their tears. Let us never,
  ever forget these hands. These hands are the hands of the people. These hands are
  the hands of the poor. These hands suffered and cried against the wind and against
  the fire. The truth only fits in these hands, only these hands know the truth. These
  tired hands raised the beauty of the people. These hands will bury the fires with
  their shadow, only these hands drowned in errors, only these hands invented errors.

page5-eng: 'Thinking about Farmer''s Day Kampesinuq P''unchaynimpi Yuyamanasun On
  the hills, at the doors of the huts, in the middle of the fields, crossing the rivers,
  traveling the roads. For a moment, men who work the land, let us think of ourselves,
  of the men who left, of the wounds of our grandparents, let us think of the men
  who died tied to the mitas, of those who were beheaded by the hands of the gamonales.
  Let us think of those lives and of this existence, men who work the land. There
  can be no true revolution if we do not first think of Man. Man is the foundation
  of this world, of the world above, of the world of shadows. He was at the beginning
  of all things and will be there after the catastrophes. Man is above all, he is
  the initial number of the orders. The world was built only by man, things were built
  for him. Peoples walk for him and even wars are sometimes fought in defense of man.
  For these reasons, the Peruvian Revolution says: Man comes first, let us build our
  people so that man lives with dignity. We do not want men to persist divided into
  two antagonistic groups of poor and rich. Let men live with one dignity, that is
  what the Peruvian Revolution says. Walking on our own we must change the political,
  economic and social system that our people choose. The substantial existence of
  the Peruvian people dawned with the law of the Agrarian Reform. When the land returned
  to the hands of its legitimate owners, the people and their soul set out on their
  journey forever. The land had no owner in its origins, it was the land that was
  there for all to live, so that by sowing in it men could live. Thinking about this
  common principle, the Peruvian Revolution returned the land to the poor men, to
  the men who truly work the land. But, it is not only that, this Revolution is putting
  the flag of the poor in the hands of the people. This Revolution is the seed of
  other days of joy. This Revolution is raising the foundations of another society
  from its foundations, for the love of children. This Revolution has given us back
  new dreams of life, a human existence and an incorruptible virile attitude. With
  this Revolution we are reaching the root of the days, we are reaching the emotional
  explosion of the heart, we are sprouting like unbreakable flowers. Looking at these
  things we must think again about Farmer''s Day: Farmers'' Day is a day without riverbanks.
  Now the land is in the hands of those who work it. For this and for this reason
  laws have been passed. The Water Law, which says that cooperatives are being built.
  Farmers receive the true wage for their efforts. We have only achieved all this
  with the Revolution. BECAUSE the Peruvian Revolution is truly a Re-revolution. The
  differences between the poor and the rich are diminishing. The poor and the rich
  are coming together, uniting as one people, bridging their differences without spilling
  blood as other revolutions did. That is the Revolution. Peruvian, Nationalist, Independent,
  Humanist. ALL of us who work on the land must be sentinels of this Revolution, we
  must take care of it, just as it remembers us, it takes care of us. We must walk
  alongside the Revolution. We must praise the Revolution, we must defend the Revolution.
  Only the Revolution is the sun of the poor. There is no great day if we do not think
  about the meaning of that day. In six years the Revolution has come a long way.
  It has forged a good path with a man''s step. Soldiers and men of the people have
  walked as one man. That is being a revolutionary: to support with work what we affirm
  with the word. In this new year, let us salute our President, General Juan Velasco
  Alvarado. And let us shout again: Yes! Once again, I swear by the Revolution. Our
  Greetings to the People of Cusco What is the meaning of the word On your day we
  greet you, people of Cusco. On behalf of all the peoples of Peru we greet you. From
  Cusco, civilization began in the time of the Incas, for the settlements of antiquity.
  Cusco is like the soul of Peru, full of memories, it is the greatest foundation
  of Peru. But we cannot exhaust ourselves looking at the years that have gone by.
  We cannot look only at what the Incas did. We must look at Cusco in its bustle of
  these days, in the sweat of our fellow countrymen, in the fountain of the children,
  in the play of those who will come. We would be looking at the dead if we only contemplated
  the walls that the Incas raised. Those roots are good, they are even better for
  explaining these days. But we must do our part, so that those who come after us
  speak of our footprints. So that they praise the walls that we raise. Let us walk
  the paths well. Let us take the rain of shadows in a beautiful life, let us bury
  the hail of tears, so that no one lives among sobs as a thorn of misfortune. We
  must welcome the day of Cusco as the end of times of mourning. Let us live other
  dawns. Let us live the days of social justice on earth, let us live the true sun
  of life, and in its fire let us live with one heart, one strength, for our people,
  for our children, for ourselves. May the people of Cusco rise this year as one man.
  And may the people, thinking of Cusco, put their hearts into everything they do.
  May the authorities order with true intelligence, may the judges look with their
  hearts at the errors of others. Forever, forever, great in your greatness, people
  of Cusco. Always see an existence of plenitude. Men who sow hatred Cheqniy tarpuq
  runakuna Why do the hatemongers, defending the gringos in bastard writings, insult
  those of us who work at La Crónica with their absolutely poisonous tongues? Why
  do the landowners'' errand boys, the former foremen, since they saw a newspaper
  in Quechua, with their obfuscated reptilian tongues, insult the workers at La Crónica?
  These men do not want us to speak in Quechua. They do not want us to speak in the
  language of the men who work the land. Those who wake up in the snows of hatred
  do not want us to speak the truth. They do not like us to talk about the Revolution.
  Those who insult the men who work at LA CRÓNICA are afraid of the Revolution. Why?
  That''s what we''re going to talk about. As we already know, they were the ones
  who in past years, with the tale of the revolution, deceived the men who work in
  the fields. They imposed quotas saying: For the party, for the party! and the party
  was their belly. They are the same ones who received money from the local bosses,
  for the art of deceiving the poor. These scams ended with the Revolution, and so,
  like stray dogs, they walk around biting whoever they can. And since what was written
  in CRONICAWAN is now enlightening the peasants, they hate those of us who write
  the truth. But we have already sworn by the flag of the Revolution. We are not afraid
  of men with thorns on their tongues, we will trample on them like worms the partisans
  of the bosses. We, like the condors, look at the horizons, we live and fly in the
  light of the sun, never will those accustomed to theft like mice, those who only
  see where they can prey, ever reach us. Our flag is our strength, the soul of the
  people sustains us and we believe in the men of the people. The men with viperous
  tongues will not reach us. Considering cold Sumaq sunquwan kamyt''asqa DEFINITION
  OF THE INFILTRATOR Infiltration and the activities of infiltrators in the revolutionary
  ranks are issues that have been repeatedly discussed in the country. It is not out
  of place to attempt a quick analysis that shows us the reasons that explain this
  phenomenon. First of all, we must agree on the nature of infiltration as a political
  act. Infiltration is an activity that consists of masking the political objectives
  of an individual or group in order to be able to penetrate other institutions and
  impose on them from within lines of action that are foreign to them. Infiltrators
  may agree with the ideological or political approaches of the organization or institution
  they intend to capture; but in reality they have different or opposing intentions.
  The infiltrator always has a double or triple game and trusts in the naivety and
  lack of perspicacity of his adversaries to crown his efforts with success. Infiltrators
  use the most varied resources to hide their activities; but one of the most frequent
  resources consists of indiscriminately accusing their adversaries of being infiltrators.
  With the aim of hiding his dark dealings, the infiltrator slanders half the world
  with the label of infiltrator. There is no doubt that the maneuver is skillful and
  that it manages to disorient some people. There is no doubt that throughout the
  process individuals and groups of various tendencies have tried and still try to
  infiltrate it. The infiltrators of all kinds started from the assumption that this
  process was relatively easy to control, since it lacked its own political organization
  and that its ideology was in the process of progressive enrichment and development.
  Without our own political organization and without an ideology published in 10 volumes,
  the infiltrators thought, we can “sell our organization ideology.” They believed
  that the rejection of the traditional parties and the lack of a dogmatic and intolerant
  ideology were symptoms of weakness. But in their strategy the infiltrators had overlooked
  a fundamental fact: that the Revolution had been initiated by the Armed Forces and
  was being led by them. This fact largely explains the failure of the infiltrators
  in their vain efforts to impose their political criteria on the process. To be successful,
  the infiltrators would have had to have first captured the command positions in
  the country’s military apparatus, a task that was certainly doomed to failure; the
  APRA had already unsuccessfully attempted this maneuver in the 1930s. Secret Chronicle
  Pakasqa Qelqa “Door of the Almudena prison, like the judge with a heart of tin,
  when I cross your doors, like the dead I rot away.” That is what I sang when I was
  in prison and the peasants who accompanied me in my misfortune cried a single tear
  with me. In prison I heard the stories of the soulless judges. Men live there for
  years, buried between walls. Remembering these things makes my heart sad. But when
  I open the newspapers now, on the first page, what they call “front page,” I read
  a news item that says: 237 peasants will be released from prison after being pardoned.
  My heart bursts with joy to hear that. The clerks, the judges, the guards and even
  the witnesses. They were all enemies of the peasants. The judges never ruled in
  favor of the peasants in the trials. But the prisons and the beatings were for the
  peasants. They were tied up like beasts inside the prisons. The Revolutionary Government
  has forgiven this suffering in its immense heart. It has said that all these men
  should return to their farms, that they should return to their villages again. It
  has said that they should get on the right path, that they should restart the life
  of true men. Prisons are becoming empty, that is good. We must receive this fact
  with applause, we must receive it with feeling. It is good that men who had the
  misfortune of making mistakes are forgiven, so that they can rise again from the
  tears of their misfortune. Life is difficult for the poor. Even the roads are lost
  in the heart of the rocks, the paths end in the woods, even joy lasts only a moment,
  nothing exists forever. The only thing that is true is the wound. The wounds of
  the men who lived in prison, watched by dark guards, are spreading. It is a cause
  for deep joy that our peasant comrades have been pardoned. They will have learned
  in years of misfortune, in endless nights, tied up, buried by the walls, and will
  say, let us walk on a good path, so that the people may rejoice with us.'
page6-eng: This is how the world we live in was formed. Hinatan pacha tiyasqanchis
  paqariran Have you ever wondered, in your wanderings or in the midst of your solitude,
  or perhaps when you looked up into the heavens; perhaps when you were ploughing
  the earth with your plow, how was this world we live in formed? Have you ever wondered
  how Father Sun began to shine? How did the stars begin to shine? Have you ever wondered
  how the moon, following in the footsteps of the sun, walks only at night? Have you
  ever wondered, ever wondered, how the world we live in was formed? Has it always
  been the same as it is now? Has it been as we know it today? Have trees always flowered
  and produced the fruits we know today? Did the qantu always show us its flowers
  as toys? Has it always been the case that the hummingbird, with its polychromatic
  flight, drank the soul of flowers? Have rivers always quenched the thirst of the
  parched land? Perhaps all their lives the beautiful eyes of the vicuñas have been
  watching the song of the winds? And the puma, did it always stalk the meat it ate?
  What was the world we live in like then? How could it have been formed? Without
  wanting to tire ourselves out, I would like to answer these questions. This is how
  the world was formed. In the beginning, the entire universe was something like a
  big cloud, in which there were explosions. Because of those explosions, because
  of those great movements, the different worlds that we know were created. But I
  must tell you that they were not as we know them today. Like an immense smoking
  bonfire, the sun was then just a sphere of fire, there were many spheres like suns,
  even now in an immensity that we do not see they exist. When these fiery suns exploded
  again and spread out again, the stars and the world we live in appeared. But this
  world we live in was also another sphere of fire. As time passed, when countless
  years passed, our world began to cool down, giving rise to the world we live in.
  But even in that world there was still no form of life. What could have lived in
  the midst of the embers. That is why this world in which we live was formed in periods,
  in epochs. These epochs are called eras. These eras occurred over billions of years.
  Only then did the most primitive forms of life appear. They appeared in the seas.
  From them emerged all the forms of life that we know today. It was then that the
  earth began to be populated by gigantic reptiles. They later gave rise to birds.
  Man followed a similar process. At first he was like an ape, he knew no work; he
  fed himself by gathering fruit from trees, later he made axes out of trees and stones
  to hunt animals to feed him. That's how he killed the puma and the deer, I must
  tell you that this man did not yet know about fire; that is why he ate his food
  raw, exactly like foxes and pumas eat.

  Ttitu Condemayta, Diego Cristóbal Tupaq Amaru, Antonio Oblitas. In this uprising,
  in this war, the dead were counted in the thousands. But this war, this revolution
  of Túpac Amaru, was defeated by the Spanish. And then in the city of Cusco, in the
  Plaza de Armas, all the leaders were killed, with much suffering. Some were hanged,
  others had their eyes gouged out first. But in order to kill Túpac Amaru, they first
  tore out his eyes. But to kill Tupaq Amaru, they first gouged out his eyes, cut
  out his tongue, then laid him out in the plaza and tied his hands and feet to four
  horses in order to dismember him. Then they burned his flesh. And when his body
  was turned to ashes, they scattered it to the wind. INDEPENDENCE Then came Independence.
  But the suffering of our people remained the same, it did not change at all. The
  landowners took over all the land and the peasants worked the land for themselves
  again. The sadness remained the same, the heartbreaking suffering did not change.
  It just continued like that. This is how we have lived. We have lived this way for
  a long time. During all those years, the peasants raised their voices again and
  again, demanding Agrarian Reform. And while demanding Agrarian Reform, many of them
  were killed. Previous Peruvian governments did not want Agrarian Reform. The rulers
  were the owners of the lands. The gamonales were in the government. Therefore, as
  they were the owners of the wealth, they ruled the entire country, so they also
  formed what we called Parliament, and they also ruled the Judiciary. For this reason,
  all laws helped the landowner and crushed the peasant. Any claim by the men of the
  town, for justice, was made by the judges who helped the landowner and ruled against
  the peasant. The men of the people, because they were poor, never, in the life of
  our country, governed, only the rich governed. For his work, the peasant did not
  receive a salary, and was forced to work the lands of the gamonal, to earn a small,
  tiny plot. Thus they lived a life that was not a life, crushed, humiliated. But
  nothing lasts forever. THE REVOLUTION DAWNED On October 3, 1968, General Juan Velasco
  Alvarado began our Revolution. General Juan Velasco Alvarado expelled the bad rulers
  saying: We cannot continue living as we have until today. So that the poor are no
  longer poor, so that no one humiliates them, so that the rich do not become richer
  by exploiting the poor, it is necessary that we make the Revolution. And then, on
  June 24, 1969, Agrarian Reform Law No. 17716 was passed. That day the dream of millions
  of men came true. That day, in our country, too, a difficult journey began: On that
  path, we began to destroy a way of life. On that path, we destroyed a whole period
  of 400 years of living in misery. With the beginning of the Agrarian Reform, we
  also began the liquidation of the inheritance of the encomenderos and the participation
  of millions of peasants who were marginalized in the economic, political, social
  and cultural life of Peru also began. AGRARIAN REFORM The Agrarian Reform is carried
  out in two consecutive periods: In the first, the land is expropriated and awarded
  to the peasants. Along with the land, the peasants are given machinery and livestock.
  This is provided for by law. In the second, after the lands have been handed over
  to the farmers, the formation of what we know as Peasant Associative Enterprises
  takes place. What are these Peasant Associative Enterprises? It is a new way of
  having land, of possessing land. These enterprises are: The Agricultural Production
  Cooperatives, which to date already total 363 Cooperatives with 1,797,336 hectares,
  for 87,926 peasant families. In addition, 50 Agricultural Societies of Social Interest
  have been formed, they have 2,250,117 hectares and group 55,058 peasant families.
  There are also 137 Peasant Communities, which have 40,011 peasant families, to which
  476,428 hectares have been given. There are also 291 Peasant Groups, to which 617,270
  hectares have been distributed, and 19,991 peasant families live within these Peasant
  Groups. Land has also been given to 17,733 farmers, for a total of 128,544 hectares.
  These awards were made until May 31, 1975. But on June 24, 450,000 hectares will
  also be given to 17,591 families, throughout Peru, in different places. All these
  land transfers to peasant organizations in Peru add up to a total of almost 10 million
  hectares. Land is also distributed to small landowners who manage, that is, work,
  their land directly, as stipulated by law. ASSOCIATIVE PEASANT COMPANIES (CAP —SAIS)
  These Peasant Associations are being established as pillars of support, and the
  Peasant Communities are also being established as pillars of support. Small landowners
  also exist in Peru. These Associative Companies are those that receive preferential
  attention in their development, and all facilities are granted to them. (This is
  what we call priority). These organizations allow both land and irrigation water
  to be used appropriately. Likewise, machinery and facilities are available to all
  farmers for general use. As the organization and work are joint, so too the distribution
  of profits must be for all workers. There are two main types of Associative Companies:
  1.- Some are the Agricultural Production Cooperatives (CAP). These cooperatives
  are indivisible. That means: All the land, all the cattle and animals, all the crops,
  all the machinery, cannot be shared. They belong to all the workers. Likewise, the
  services provided by the Cooperative are for everyone. Cooperative members are all
  those who work on the land, as provided by law. 1. - The others are the Agricultural
  Companies of Social Interest (SAIS), here too the land, the livestock, the machinery,
  everything that exists in the SAIS, cannot be divided. Nothing belongs to one man.
  Everything belongs to everyone. These SAIS are made up of all the Rural Communities
  of the Sector and a Services Cooperative. Thus, with joy, the Agrarian Reform advances
  in our country. But the Agrarian Reform Law would not have been complete if it had
  not been integrated with the General Water Law. This law eliminated ownership of
  water. The Agrarian Reform has achieved the following achievements: 1.— He has eliminated
  the power of the gamonales. 2.— The best arable lands have been awarded to the Peasant
  Associations. But, without forgetting that there are small and medium-sized owners
  who manage their lands directly and efficiently. 3.— Political power has been granted
  to the peasants, through the emergence of the powerful National Agrarian Confederation.
  This is how what the leader of the Peruvian Revolution, General Juan Velasco Alvarado,
  said on June 24, 1969, is fulfilled: "PEASANT, THE BOSS WILL NO LONGER EAT FROM
  YOUR POVERTY." With this message, he freed 6 million peasants 6 years ago. The liberation
  of these men is a path of no return.'

page2-esp: 'Pagina 2 Bases ideológicas de la revolución peruana La Revolución Peruana
  es un proceso autónomo que se desarrolla para transformar el sistema político, económico
  y social del De y cancelar nuestra condición de sociedad subdesarrollada, capitalista,
  oligárquica y sometida a los intereses del imperialismo, a fin de construir una
  democracia social en que todos los peruanos puedan realizarse a través de la plena
  participación en el ejercicio del poder social dentro de una comunidad nacional
  verdaderamente soberana. La Revolución Peruana se define como Nacionalista e Independiente
  y doctrinariamente se fundamenta en un Humanismo Revolucionario de clara oposición
  a los sistemas de explotación social y a los dogmáticos y totalitarios. Por tanto,
  recusa los sistemas capitalista y comunista. 1.-POR SER NACIONALISTA. — Afirma y
  defiende la soberanía del Perú, garantizando su desarrollo autónomo y su seguridad
  integral; — Recoge y desarrolla el legado histórico y cultural de pueblo peruano,
  en particular sus tradiciones de trabajo solidario y propiedad comunal; —Busca la
  afirmación de nuestra personalidad nacional, reconociendo y estimulando sus diversas
  variantes culturales y sociales; —Propugna la auténtica y transformadora integración
  del Perú como entidad social y política; —Defiende indeclinablemente los recursos
  de la Nación; y — Asegura el derecho de los peruanos a “desarrollar concepciones
  ideológicas y políticas, expresiones culturales y formas institucionales propias
  surgidas de la tradición histórica y del espíritu creador de nuestro pueblo. 2.-POR
  SER INDEPENDIENTE. — Afirma su plena autonomía conceptual y política y rechaza,
  por ello, cualquier intento de interferencia extranjera; — Asume una actitud militante
  contra toda forma de dominación externa o de dependencia política, económica o militar
  respecto de cualquier centro internacional de poder; — Orienta sus acciones hacia
  el logro de la integración y el autónomo desarrollo regional de América Latina.
  —Declara su posición de país no alineado y se ubica entre los países tercermundista;
  y — Propugna un nuevo concepto de las relaciones y cooperación Internacionales,
  para construir una efectiva comunidad de naciones libres y soberanas basada en la
  igualdad. Por ser Nacionalista e Independiente, la Revolución Peruana mantiene una
  irrenciable posición antiimperialista. Consecuentemente, respalda la Ficha de los
  pueblos contra toda forma de imperialismo, colonialismo y subordinación internacional.
  3.- EL HUMANISMO REVOLUCIONARIO. — Considera al hombre como fin y no como medio,
  reconociéndolo hacedor social de la historia; —Postula la realización plena de la
  persona humana, concibiendo la libertad y la justicia como valores inseparables
  y rechazando toda forma de explotación; —Aspira a la construcción de una verdadera
  convivencia humana fundada en la solidaridad; — Promueve la liberación del hombre
  frente a toda forma de dominación y recusa, por tanto, la existencia de cualquier
  oligarquía: — Propugna una moral para la acción basada en la correspondencia entre
  medios y fines: y — Reconoce la tolerancia como valor y, por ende, rechaza el dogmatismo
  negando la violencia como sistema. En el Humanismo Revolucionario convergen importantes
  vertientes de pensamiento social surgidas de la tradición histórica universal a
  la cual el Perú pertenece. Tal legado se expresa esencialmente en el pensamiento
  socialista, en el pensamiento libertario y en el pensamiento cristiano. En ellos
  la Revolución Peruana encuentra fuente fundamental de inspiración para su acción
  transformadora. 1. El Humanismo Revolucionario se nutre en el legado del pensamiento
  socialista no dogmático ni totalitario al: —Postular que el trabajo es la fuente
  original de la riqueza; — Plantear que, dentro de una economía pluralista, los medios
  de producción sean prioritariamente de propiedad social; —Promover el rol de la
  propiedad estatal en beneficio de toda la comunidad nacional, dentro de la mueva
  concepción del Estado Participatorio, y —Aspirar a un ordenamiento en el cual los
  bienes socialmente generados beneficien a sus productores y a toda la sociedad.
  1. El Humanismo Revolucionario acoge la herencia del Pensamiento libertario al:
  —Postular dentro de una sociedad solidaria, como derecho inviolable, la esencial
  libertad del ser humano frente a toda forma de arbitrariedad e imposición; —Propugnar
  que el poder y las decisiones surjan con la menor intermediación posible, desde
  la base social en concordancia con los intereses de toda la nación; y — Promover
  el sentido creador de las personas y de los grupos afirmando su autonomía y responsabilidad
  social para adoptar sus propias decisiones. 1. El Humanismo Revolucionario se inspira
  en el pensamiento cristiano al: —Sostener la igualdad esencial de todos los hombres,
  fundamento de la fraternidad humana, y rechazar, en consecuencia, todas las formas
  de injusticia social y económica, —Relievar el valor de la solidaridad y proponer
  la eliminación de las causas que históricamente han creado la desigualdad, el odio
  y la lucha entre peruanos; —Afirmar que sólo construyendo una sociedad justa, pueden
  los hombres tener una verdadera libertad y desarrollar plenamente su personalidad
  en todas sus dimensiones; —Aspirar a la construcción de una auténtica convivencia
  humana para lograr una sociedad sin explotadores ni explotados, única base real
  de unión entre todos los peruanos; y -Reconocer que la familia constituye el fundamento
  de la sociedad y es escuela del más rico humanismo. 1. La esencia de estas tradiciones
  revolucionarias se expresa en el fundamental carácter participatorio de la Revolución
  Peruana que: —Postula la apertura de amplios y múltiples canales que den acceso
  a todos los peruanos a las decisiones en los diversos niveles y campos de la actividad
  social: —Afirma que la existencia de instituciones basadas en la intervención democrática
  de sus miembros, es condición esencial para el desarrollo pleno de las personas
  y grupos sociales: —Promueve el empleo de métodos auténticamente democráticos en
  el logro de sus objetivos políticos, sociales y: económicos; —Preconiza una nueva
  concepción de la estructura del Estado basado en la eliminación del centralismo
  y la burocratización; —Propugna el acceso organizado a los trabajadores a la dirección,
  propiedad y a las utilidades de las empresas. — Favorece la progresiva transferencia
  del poder económico y político para su ejercicio social por instituciones autónomas
  de los trabajadores peruanos y, por tanto, rechaza su concentración manipuladora;
  —Defiende la autonomía de las organizaciones sociales frente a todo intento de control
  externo a ellas y, consecuentemente, rechaza la propia institucionalizacion política
  de la Revolución en forma de partido. e: Obedeciendo al sentido de estas tradiciones
  la Revolución Peruana asume un fundamental carácter pluralista en virtud del cual.
  - Reconoce el derecho de todos los peruanos a la discrepancia y a la critica y,
  en consecuencia, a organizarse políticamente con entera libertad para sostener distintas
  posiciones. Por tanto, adminite la legitimidad de la existencia de agrupaciones
  y partidos que expresen diversas alternativas políticas. Frente a ellas la Revolución
  Peruana plantea su propia posición, coherente y homogénea, no aceptando dentro de
  sus filas planteamientos que contradigan o desvirtúen sus fundamentos ideopolíticos;
  y — Auspicia en el campo económico diversas formas de propiedad y de organización
  de las empresas, dentro de una concepción dinámica y flexible, reconociendo; un
  prioritario sector de propiedad social en el cual la propiedad corresponde a todos
  los trabajadores de las empresas del sector; un sector estatal en el cual el Estado
  asume el control de actividades básicas para el desarrollo y el beneficio de la
  comunidad; un sector privado reformado que conduzca a la cogestión y un sector de
  propiedad exclusivamente privado integrado por las actividades de pequeña escala
  en el comercio, la industria artesanal y los servicios. 4.- A partir de estas bases
  ideológicas, la Revolución Peruana plantea como su objetivo final la construcción
  de una DEMOCRACIA SOCIAL DE PARTICIPACION PLENA cuyos elementos esenciales son:
  1. Un sistema político participatorio apoyado en las bases populares; 2. Un sistema
  económico pluralista basado en un prioritario sector de propiedad social; y 3. Un
  sistema social sustentado en un conjunto de comportamientos y valores morales que
  enfaticen la justicia, la libertad, el trabajo, la participación, la solidaridad,
  la creatividad, la honradez y el respeto por la dignidad de la persona humana. Lima,

  él está haciendo muy bien en cortar con mano firme los intentos de oposición y al
  mismo tiempo y con la misma firmeza pone en su lugar lo que hasta ahora estuvo en
  caos. Por esta razón, estamos pletóricos de contento los cusqueños. Hoy levantando
  muy en alto nuestra frente hablaremos en esa misma altura nuestro idioma, ya nadie
  se humillará, aún cuando nos zahiriera con el cholo y el indio. Por esta carta hago
  un llamado a todos los comuneros de Pumamarca, para que con inmensa alegría y poniendo
  firme nuestra fuerza, hagamos producir la madre tierra generosamente; para que así
  ayudemos a nuestra Revolución. No podrán quitarnos a nosotros nuestras tierras,
  quienes como la Asociación Pro Vivienda Santa Rosa, con el membrete de “revolucionarios”,

  Hemos ido a todos los lugares, hemos conocido sus historias, todas sus luchas. Hemos

  modeladas en el fuego, que empuñaron todos los desprecios y arrollaron todos los

page5-esp: 'Pagina 5 Pensando en el dia del campesino Kampesinuq P’unchaynimpi Yuyamanasun
  Sobre los cerros, en Jas puertas de las chozas, en medio de las chacras, salvando
  los ríos, recorriendo los caminos. Por un instante hombres que trabajan en la tierra
  pensemos en nosotros mismos, en los hombres que se fueron, en las heridas de nuestros
  abuelos, pensemos en los hombres que murieron amarrados a las mitas, a los que fueron
  degollados por las manos de los gamonales. Pensemos en esas vidas y en esta existencia,
  hombres que trabajan en la tierra. No puede haber verdadera revolución, si antes
  no se piensa en el Hombre. El hombre es el fundamento de este mundo, del mundo de
  arriba, del mundo de las sombras. El estuvo en el comienzo de todas las cosas y
  estará después de las catástrofes. El hombre está por encima de todo, es el número
  inicia) de tos órdenes. Sólo por el hombre se ha construido el mundo, para él se
  han levantado las cosas. Por él caminan los pueblos y hasta las guerras, son a veces,
  en defensa del hombre. Por esas razones, la Revolución Peruana, dice: El hombre
  está primero, construyamos nuestro pueblo para que el hombre viva con dignidad.
  No queremos que los hombres persistan divididos en dos grupos antagónicos de pobres
  y de ricos. Que los hombres vivan una sola dignidad, eso dice la Revolución Peruana.
  Caminando por nosotros mismos debemos cambiar el sistema político, económico y social
  de nuestro pueblo elige. La existencia sustancial del Pueblo del Perú amaneció con
  la ley de la Reforma Agraria. Cuando la tierra volvió a manos de sus legítimos poseedores,
  el pueblo y su alma se echaron a andar para siempre. La tierra no tuvo dueño en
  sus origines, para que todos vivan fue la tierra, para que sembrando en ella los
  hombres vivan. Pensando en ese principio común, la Revolución Peruana, devolvió
  la tierra entre los hombres pobres, entre los hombres que verdaderamente trabajan
  la tierra. Pero, no sólo es eso, esta Revolución, está poniendo la bandera de los
  pobres en manos del pueblo. Esta Revolución es semilla de otros días de júbilo.
  Está Revolución está levantando los fundamentos de otra sociedad desde sus cimientos,
  por amor a los niños. Esta Revolución nos ha devuelto, nuevos sueños de vida, una
  existencia de hombres y una actitud viril insobornable. Con esta Revolución estamos
  llegando a la raíz de los días, estamos llegando a la explosión emotiva del corazón,
  estamos brotando como flores inquebrables. Mirando esas cosas debemos volver a pensar
  en el Día del Campesino: El Día del Campesino es un día sin riberas. Ahora la tierra
  está en manos de quienes lo trabajan. Para eso y por eso las leyes se han dado.
  La Ley de aguas que dicen se levantan las cooperativas. Los campesinos reciben el
  verdadero jornal a sus esfuerzos. A todo eso hemos alcanzado sólo con la Revolución.
  PORQUE la Revolución Peruana es verdaderamente una Rerevolución. Disminuyen las
  diferencias entre pobres y ricos. Los pobres y los ricos se acercan, se unen como
  un sólo pueblo, salvan sus diferencias sin derramar san como hicieron otras revoluciones.
  Eso es la Revolución. Peruana, Nacionalista, Independiente, Humanista. TODOS los
  hombres que trabajamos en la tierra tenemos que ser centinelas de esta Revolución,
  tenemos que cuidarla, así como ella recuerda de nosotros nos cuida. Debemos caminar
  junto con la Revolución. Debemos loar a la Revolución, debemos defender la Revolución.
  Sólo la Revolución es el sol, de los pobres. No hay gran día si no pensamos en el
  significado de ese día, En seis años la Revolución ha recorrido un extenso camino.
  Ha tramontado buena trocha con paso de varón. Han caminado soldados y hombres del
  pueblo como un sólo hombre. Eso es ser revolucionario: apuntalar con trabajo lo
  que aseveramos con el verbo. En este nuevo año saludemos a nuestro Presidente el
  General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Y volvamos a gritar: ¡Sí,! De nuevo vuelvo a jurar
  por la Revolución. Nuestro Saludo al pueblo del Cusco Qusqu llaqtatan napaykuyku
  En tu día te saludamos pueblo del Cusco. En nombre de todos los pueblos del Perú
  te saludamos. Desde el Cusco partió la civilización en la época de los Inca, para
  los poblados de la antigüedad. El Cusco es como si fuera el alma del Perú, lleno
  de recuerdos, es el más gran de fundamento del Perú. Pero no podemos agotamos mirando
  los años que se fueron. No podemos mirar únicamente lo que los incas hicieron. Debemos
  mirar al Cusco en su trajín de estos días, en el sudor de nuestros coterráneos,
  en la fuente de los niños, en el juego de los que vendrán. Estaríamos mirando a
  los muertos, si sólo contemplásemos los muros que los Incas levantaron. Son buenas
  esas raíces, son mejores aún para explicar estos días. Pero, nosotros debemos hacer
  nuestra parte, para que los que vienen hablen de nuestras huellas. Para que alaben
  los muros que nosotros levantemos. Caminemos bien los senderos. Tomemos la lluvia
  de las sombras en un vivir hermoso, enterremos los granizos del llanto. para que
  nadie viva entre sollozos como espina de infortunio. El día del Cusco debemos recibirlo
  como el final de los tiempos de luto. Vivamos otros amaneceres. Vivamos los días
  de la justicia social en la tierra, vivamos el verdadero sol de la vida, y a su
  fuego vivamos un sólo corazón, una sola fuerza, por nuestro pueblo. por nuestros
  hijos, por nosotros mismos. El pueblo del Cusco que ascienda por este año como un
  solo hombre. Y que el pueblo pensando en el Cusco ponga su corazón en todas las
  cosas que realice. Que las autoridades ordenen con verdadera inteligencia, que los
  jueces miren con el corazón los errores de otros. Para siempre, por siempre, grande
  en tu grandeza pueblo del Cusco. Vie siempre una existencia de plenitudes. Los hombres
  que siembran odios Cheqniy tarpuq runakuna ¿Por qué los sembradores de odios, defendiendo
  a los gringos en bastardos escritos, con sus lenguas de tósigo absoluto nos insultan
  a los que trabajamos en La Crónica? ¿Por que los mandaderos de los hacendados, los
  antiguos caporales, desde que vieron un periódico en quechua, con sus lenguas de
  reptiles ofuscados, insultan a los trabajadores de La Crónica? Esos hombres no quieren
  que se hable en quechua. No quieren que dialoguemos en el idioma de los hombres
  que trabajan la tierra. Los amanecidos en las nievas del odio no quieren que hablemos
  la verdad. No les gusta que hablemos de la Revolución. Los que insultan a los hombres
  que trabajan en LA CRONICA, se asustan de la Revolución ¿Por qué? Eso vamos a hablar.
  Como ya los conocemos, ellos fueron los que en años pasados, con el cuento de la
  revolución engañaron a los hombres que trabajan en el campo. Impusieron cuotas diciendo:
  ¡Para el partido, para el partido! y el partido era la barriga de ellos. Son los
  mismos que recibían dinero de los gamonales, por el arte de engañar a los pobres.
  Esas estafas terminaron con la Revolución, por eso como los perros sin dueño, caminan
  mordiendo a quien pueden. Y como lo escrito en CRONICAWAN llegan ahora esclarecedor
  a los campesinos, nos odian de corazón a quienes escribimos verdades. Pero, ya hemos
  jurado por la bandera de la Revolución. No nos asustan los hombres que tienen espinos
  en la lengua, los pisaremos como a gusanos a los partidarios de los gamonales. Nosotros
  como los cóndores miramos los horizontes, vivimos y volamos a la luz del sol, jamás
  los acostumbrados al robo como los ratones, los que sólo ven donde pueden depredar,
  nunca nos alcanzaran. Nuestra bandera es nuestra fuerza, el alma del pueblo nos
  sostiene y creemos en los hombres del pueblo. No nos alcanzarán los hombres de lenguas
  viperinas. Considerando en frio Sumaq sunquwan kamyt’asqa DEFINICION DEL INFILTRADO
  La infiltración y las actividades de los infiltrados en las filas revolucionarias
  constituyen temas que reiteradamente han sido discutidos en el país No está demás
  por ello intentar un rápido análisis que nos muestre las razones que explican dicho
  fenómeno. Ante todo es preciso ponemos de acuerdo en el carácter de la infiltración
  como hecho político. La infiltración es una actividad consistente en el enmascaramiento
  de los objetivos políticos de un individuo o un grupo con el fin de poder penetrar
  en otras e instituciones e imponer en ellas desde adentro lineas de acción que les
  es son ajenas. Los infiltrados podrían estar de acuerdo con los planteamientos ideológicos
  o políticos de la organización o institución que pretenden capturar; pero en realidad
  tienen intenciones distintas o contrapuestas. El infiltrado siempre tiene un doble
  o triple juego y confía en la ingenuidad y falta de perspicacia de sus adversarios
  para coronar con éxito sus esfuerzos. Los infiltrados utilizan los recursos más
  variados para ocultar sus actividades; pero uno de los recursos más frecuentes cosiste
  en acusar indiscriminadamente a sus adversarios de infiltrados. Con la finalidad
  de ocultar sus oscuros manejos el infiltrado calumnia a medio mundo con el calificativo
  de infiltrado. No cabe duda que la maniobra es hábil y que consigue desorientar
  a algunas personas. No cabe duda tampoco que a lo largo del proceso individuos y
  grupos de diversas tendencias han pretendido y aún pretenden infiltrarlo. Los infiltrados
  de toda especie partieron del supuesto de que este proceso era relativamente fácil
  de controlar, ya que carecía de una organización política propia y que su ideología
  se hallaba en trance de enriquecimiento y desarrollo progresivo. Sin organización
  política propia y sin una ideología publicada en 10 tomos, pensaron los infiltrados,
  nosotros podemos “vender nuestra organización ideología". Creyeron pues, que el
  rechazo a los partidos tradicionales y la falta de una ideología dogmática e intolerante
  eran síntomas de debilidad. Pero en su estrategia los infiltrados habían pasado
  por alto un hecho fundamental: que la Revolución había sido iniciada por la Fuerza
  Armada y que era conducida por ella. Este hecho explica en buena parte el fracaso
  de los infiltrados en sus esfuerzos vanos por imponer sus criterios políticos en
  el proceso. Para tener éxito los infiltrados tendrían que haber capturado primero
  las posiciones de mando en el aparato militar del país, tarea que ciertamente estaba
  condenada al fracaso; ya el APRA en la década del 30 intentó sin éxito esta maniobra.
  Cronica Secreta Pakasqa Qelqa “Puerta de la cárcel de la Almudena, como el juez
  con corazón de lata, al trasponer tus puertas, como los muertos me voy pudriendo”.
  Eso cantaba cuando estuve en la cárcel y conmigo lloraban una sola lágrima los campesinos
  que me acompañaban en el infortunio. En la cárcel escuché las historias de los jueces
  sin alma. Allí viven los hombres por años, enterrados entre paredes. Recordando
  esas cosas mi corazón camina entristecido. Pero, al abrir ahora los periódicos,
  en la primera página en lo que dicen “primera plana” leo una noticia, que dice así:
  Saldrán de la cárcel indultados 237 campesinos. Reviente de alegría mi corazón al
  saber eso. Los escribanos, los jueces, los guardias y hasta los testigos. Todos
  eran enemigos de los campesinos. Nunca los jueces en los juicios le daban la razón
  a los campesinos. Pero, las cárceles, las palizas eran para los campesinos. Como
  bestias eran amarrados dentro de las cárceles. Ese sufrimiento, el Gobierno Revolucionario
  en su inmenso corazón ha perdonado. Todos esos hombres que vuelvan a sus chacras
  ha dicho, que regresen a sus pueblos de nuevo. Que se pongan en el buen camino,
  que reinicien vida de verdaderos hombres ha dicho. Se están quedando las cárceles
  vacías, eso está bien. Debemos recibir ese hecho con aplausos, debemos recibir con
  sentimiento. Esta bien que se perdone a los hombres que tuvieron la desgracia de
  cometer errores, para que vuelvan a levantarse desde las lágrimas de sus infortunios.
  Es difícil la vida para los pobres. Hasta los caminos se pierden en el corazón de
  las rocas, en los bosques concluyen los caminos, hasta la alegría dura apenas un
  instante, nada existe por siempre. Lo único verdadero es la herida. Se extienden
  las heridas de los hombres que vivieron en la cárcel observados por oscuros vigilantes.
  Es para alegrarse por hondo, el hecho que nuestros compañeros campesinos hayan sido
  indultados. Ellos en años de infortunio, en noches interminables, amarrados, sepultados
  por las paredes, habrán aprendido y dirán, caminemos por un buen camino, para que
  el pueblo se alegre con nosotros.'
page6-esp: Pagina 6 Asi se formo el mundo en que vivimos. Hinatan pacha tiyasqanchis
  paqariran Alguna vez en tus andanzas o en medio de tu soledad, o tal vez cuando
  mirabas a lo alto de los cielos; quizá cuando herías la tierra con el arado; no
  te has preguntado ¿cómo se ha formado este mundo en que vivimos? ¿No te has preguntado,
  cómo empezó el padre sol a resplandor? ¿Cómo empezaron a alumbrar las estrellas?
  ¿No te has preguntado, cómo es que la luna siguiendo las huellas del sol, camina
  sólo de noche? ¿No te has preguntado, pero no te has preguntado, cómo se ha formado
  el mundo en que vivimos? Es que acaso siempre ha sido igual que ahora, habrá sido
  tal cual conocemos hoy? ¿Desde siempre florecieron los árboles y tuvieron los frutos
  que hoy conocemos, acaso siempre el qantu nos mostró sus flores como juguetes? ¿Fue
  desde siempre que el colibrí con su volar polícromo bebió el alma de las flores?
  ¿Acaso fue desde siempre que los ríos saciaron la sed de la tierra resecada? ¿Tal
  vez toda la vida los bellos ojos de las vicuñas avizoraron el canto de los vientos?
  ¿Y el puma, acaso siempre acechó la carne que comía? ¿Cómo fue entonces el mundo
  en que vivimos? , ¿cómo pudo haberse formado? Sin querer cansarnos quiero dar respuesta
  a estas preguntas. Así se ha formado el mundo. En un principio todo el universo
  fue algo así como una gran nube, en ella hubieron explosiones. Por esas explosiones,
  por esos grandes movimientos se crearon los diferentes mundos que conocemos. Pero
  debo decirles, que no fueron como hoy lo conocemos. Como una inmensa fogata humeante
  fueron, el sol entonces fue apenas una esfera de fuego, fueron muchas esferas como
  soles, aún ahora en una inmensidad que no vemos existen. Cuando estos soles de fuego,
  volvieron a explotar y volvieron a espaciarse, aparecieron las estrellas y el mundo
  en que vivimos. Pero este mundo en que vivimos, fue también otra esfera de fuego.
  Al pasar el tiempo, cuando incontables años se sucedieron, empezó a enfriarse nuestro
  mundo; para dar origen al mundo en que vivimos. Pero aún en ese mundo no hubo todavía
  ninguna forma de vida. Qué pudo haber vivido en medio de las brasas. Por eso este
  mundo en que vivimos se fue formando por períodos, por épocas. Estas épocas se llaman
  eras. Esas eras se fueron sucediendo en miles de millones de años. Recién aparecieron
  entonces las formas más primitivas de la vida. Aparecieron en los mares. De ellos
  emergieron todas las formas de vida que hoy conocemos. Fue entonces que tierra empezó
  a poblarse de gigantescos reptiles. Ellos dieron más tarde origen a las aves. El
  hombre siguió un proceso semejante. Al principio fue como un simio, no conocía el
  trabajo; se alimentaba recogiendo el fruto de los árboles, más tarde hizo de árboles
  y de piedras hachas, para cazar animales que lo alimentaran. Fue así como mató al
  puma y al venado, Debo decirles que este hombre no conocía aún el fuego; por eso
  sus alimentos los comía crudos, exactamente igual como comen los zorros y los pumas.

  agraria puririshan TAWANTINSUYU : Antes de que los españoles llegaran a nuestro
  país, ya en esto nuestro Perú, nuestros antepasados trabajaban la tierra ayudándose
  mutuamente. El producto de ese trabajo en la tierra, era para todos los hombres,
  no se conocía la miseria. Las tierras no pertenecían a nadie en forma individual.
  Pertenecía a todos los hombres que la trabajaban, y ellos ay ayudándose los unos
  a los otros la hacían producir. Hacían la mink''a, también el ayni, y de ese modo
  trabajaban la tierra, colaborándose. El trabajo era alegre, con cantos y danzas
  alegraban el trabajo. LLEGAN LOS EXTRANJEROS Cuando llegaron los españoles, ellos
  se apropiaron de las tierras de nuestros antepasados y se la repartieron. Desde
  entonces, los hombres de nuestro pueblo trabajaron pasa los españoles, así b ordenaron
  ellos. Desapareció el gozo y alegría por el trabajo. Un trabajo demasiado pesado
  apareció; el palo y los malos tratos menudearon en reemplazo de las danzas. Y asi
  apareció la mit''a, para el sufrimiento de los hombres. TUPAQ AMARU SE LEVANTA Era
  tanto el sufrimiento de estos hombres, que en el Cusco, se levantó Tupaq Amaru,
  en defensa de sus hermanos y sus hermanas. . . Se levantó en rebelión y en guerra;
  junto a él todos los hombres y mujeres también se levantaron. Los principales de
  la rebelión, se llaman según recuerdo, Micaela Bastidas Phuyuqhawa, Pedro Vilca,
  Apaza, Tomasa Ttitu Condemayta, Diego Cristóbal Tupaq Amaru, Antonio Oblitas. En
  este levantamiento, en esta guerra, los muertos se contaron por millares. Pero,
  esta guerra, esta revolución de Túpac Amaru, fue derrotada por los españoles. Y
  entonces en la ciudad del Cusco, en la Plaza de Armas, todos los dirigentes fueron
  muertos, con mucho sufrimiento. A unos los ahoracaron, a otros antes les arrancaron
  los ojos. Pero a Túpac Amaru, para matarlo primero le arrancaron los ojos. Pero
  a Tupaq Amaru, para matarlo primero de arrancaron los ojos, le cortaron la lengua,
  después lo tendieron en la plaza y le amarraron las manos y los pies a 4 caballos,
  para descuartizarlo. Luego quemaron sus carnes. Y cuando su cuerpo fue convertido
  en cenizas, lo esparcieron en el viento. INDEPENDENCIA Después llegó la Independencia.
  Pero, el sufrimiento de nuestro pueblo, siguió igual, no sufrió ningún cambio. Los
  gamonales se apropiaron de todas las tierras y para ellos nuevamente los campesinos
  trabajaron la tierra. La tristeza continuó igual, el sufrimiento desgarrador no
  cambió. Así nomás siguió. Así hemos vivido. Mucho tiempo hemos vivido así. Durante
  todos esos años, los campesinos una y otra voz se levantaron pidiendo Reforma Agraria.
  Y pidiendo Reforma Agraria, muchos de ellos encontraron la muerte. Los anteriores
  gobiernos del Perú, no querían que haya Reforma Agraria. Los gobernantes, eran dueños
  de las tierras. Los gamonales estaban en el gobierno. Por eso, como ellos eran dueños
  de la riqueza, ordenaban en todo el país, así también ellos formaban lo que llamábamos
  Parlamento, y ordenaban también al Poder Judicial. Por eso también, todas las leyes
  ayudaban al dueño de las tierras, y aplastaban al campesino. Cualquier reclamación
  de los hombres del pueblo, para que se les haga Justicia, los jueces ayudaban al
  dueño de las tierras y fallaban contra el campesino. Los hombres del pueblo, porque
  eran pobres, jamás, en la vida de nuestro país, gobernaron, gobernaban solo los
  ricos. Por su trabajo, el campesino no recibía salario, y estaba obligado a trabajar
  las tierras del gamonal, para agarrar una chacra pequeña, pequeñita. Así vivieron
  la vida que no era vida, aplastados, humillados. Pero nada es eterno. AMANECIO LA
  REVOLUCION El 3 de octubre de 1968, inició nuestra Revolución el General Juan Velasco
  Alvarado. El General Juan Velasco Alvarado, expulsó a los malos gobernantes diciendo:
  No podemos seguir viviendo como hasta hoy. Para que los pobres ya no sean pobres,
  para que nadie los humille, para que los ricos no se vuelvan más ricos explotando
  a los pobres, es necesario que hagamos la Revolución. Y entonces, el 24 de junio
  de 1969, se dictó la Ley de Reforma Agraria Nro. 17716. Ese día el sueño de millones
  de hombres se volvió realidad. Ese día también en nuestro país se inició un difícil
  camino: Por ese camino empezamos a derrumbar un modo de vida. Por ese camino destruimos
  todo un periodo de 400 años de haber vivido en la miseria. Con ese inicio de la
  Reforma Agraria, también iniciamos la liquidación de la herencia de los encomenderos
  y también se da comienzo a la participación en la vida económica, política, social
  y cultural del Perú a millones de campesinos que estaban marginados. REFORMA AGRARIA
  La Reforma Agraria se realiza en dos períodos consecutivos: En el primero, se procede
  a la expropiación de las tierras y su adjudicación a los campesinos, junto con las
  tierras se les entrega a los campesinos la maquinaria y el ganado. Así lo dispone
  la ley. En el segundo, después que las tierras han sido entregadas a los campesinos,
  se procede a la formación de los que conocemos con el nombre de Empresas Asociativas
  Campesinas. ` Que son estas Empresas Asociativas Campesinas. Es una nueva manera
  de tener la tierra, de poseer la tierra. Esas empresas son: Las Cooperativas Agrarias
  de Producción, que a fecha ya suman 363 Cooperativas con 1''797,336 hectáreas, para
  87,926 familias campesinas. Así también se han formado 50 Sociedades Agrícolas de
  interés Social, ellos tienen 2''250,117 hectáreas y agrupan a 55,058 familias campesinas.
  También existen 137 Comunidades Campesinas, que tienen 40,011 familias campesinas,
  s ellos se les ha entregado 476,428 hectáreas. También hay 291 Grupos Campesinos,
  a ellos se les ha repartido 617,270 hectáreas, y viven dentro de estos Grupos Campesinos,
  19,991 familias campesinas. También se ha entregado tierras a 17,733 campesinos,
  por un total de 128,544 hectáreas. Estas adjudicaciones se han realizado hasta el
  31 de mayo de 1975,. Pero el 24 de junto, también se entregará 450,000 hectáreas
  a 17,591 familias, en todo el Perú, en diferentes lugares. Todas estas entregas
  de tierras a las organizaciones campesinas en el Perú, suman en total casi 10 millones
  de hectáreas. ` También se reparte tierras a los pequeños propietarios que conducen,
  es decir trabajan, directamente sus tierras, conforme señala la ley. EMPRESAS ASOCIATIVÁS
  CAMPESINAS (CAP —SAIS) Estas Empresas Asociativas Campesinas, so están levantando
  como columnas de sostenimiento, igualmente se están levantando como columnas de
  sostenimiento, igualmente se están levantando las Comunidades Campesinas. Existen
  también en el Perú, los pequeños propietarios. Estas Empresas Asociativas, son las
  que tienen atención preferente en su desarrollo, a ellos se les otorga todas las
  facilidades. (A esto conocernos con el término prioridad). Estas organizaciones,
  permiten que tanto las tierras como las aguas de regadío sean convenientemente utilizadas.
  Así también las maquinarias e instalaciones es para todos los campesinos, para uso
  general. Como la organización y el trabajo es conjunto, así también el reparto de
  las utilidades ha de ser para todos los trabajadores. Existen dos clases principales
  de Empresas Asociativas: 1.- Unas son las Cooperativas Agrarias de Producción (CAP).
  Estas cooperativas son indivisibles. Eso quiere decir: Todas las tierras, todo el
  ganado y los animales, todos los sembríos, toda la maquinaria, no se puede repartir.
  Pertenece a todos los trabajadores. Igualmente los servicios que presta la Cooperativa
  es para todos. Cooperativistas son todos los que trabajan en la tierra, así lo dispone
  la ley. 1. - Las otras son las Sociedades Agrícolas de Interés Social (SAIS), aquí
  también la tierra, el ganado, la maquinaria, todo lo que existe en la SAIS, no se
  puede dividir. Nada pertenece a un solo hombre. Todo pertenece a todos. Estas SAIS,
  están compuestas por todas las Comunidades Campesinas del Sector y una Cooperativa
  de Servicios. Así, con alborozo, camina la Reforma Agraria en nuestro país. Pero
  la Ley do Reforma Agraria no habría sido completa, si no se integraba con la Ley
  General de Aguas. Esa ley eliminó la propiedad sobre las aguas. La Reforma Agraria,
  ha conseguido estos logros: 1.— Ha eliminado el poder de los gamonales. 2.— Las
  mejores tierras de labranza, han sido adjudicadas a las Empresas Asociativas Campesinas.
  Pero, sin olvidar que existen pequeños y medianos propietarios que conducen directamente
  y de manera eficiente sus tierras. 3.— Se ha logrado otorgar poder político a los
  campesinos, a través del surgimiento de la poderosa Confederación Nacional Agraria.
  Así se cumple lo que el 24 de junio de 1969, el Jefe de la Revolución Peruana General
  Juan Velasco Alvarado dijo: “CAMPESINO EL PATRON NO COMERA MAS DE TU POBREZA”. Con
  este mensaje, hace 6 años que liberó a 6 millones de campesinos. La liberación de
  esos hombres, es un camino sin regreso.'
